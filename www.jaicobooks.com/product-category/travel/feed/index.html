										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Simplistic perceptions of the Islamic world quickly dissolve in 40 Days and 1001 Nights as globetrotting American dancer, author and filmmaker Tamalyn Dallal takes you on an unforgettable journey.</p>
<p>Without an agenda or expectations, Ms. Dallal sets out to live in five Islamic cultures for 40 days each. She finds herself in the tsunami-ravaged city of Banda Aceh, Indonesia, then ventures deep into the Egyptian Sahara to the Siwa Oasis, where donkey carts are the main form of transport. She follows a beautiful song to the forgotten island of Zanzibar, where sun and surf crash against a tumultuous past. Next, she lands in Jordan, a peaceful kingdom and haven for refugees from strife-torn lands, and finally spends 40 days in China’s largest province, the predominantly Muslim Xinjiang Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>Join the adventure, release your fears and gain a new perspective on a wide slice of our world that we hear so much and know so little about. You will be surprised, delighted and sometimes shocked at the fascinating web of true-life tales told by this 21st century Scheherezade.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the summer of 2011, two bleary-eyed kids, teetering on the cusp of adulthood, decide to drop out of the daily grind and just travel. But once they hit the road, their plans go out the window. Soon, they are barreling over potholes the size of lunar craters in Nepal, bungee jumping in Rishikesh, waking up to Buddhist chants in Sikkim and cycling down the world’s highest motorable pass in Ladakh. On the way is a constant stream of oddballs, like the five-second-tea lady, the flute-playing hotel manager, flying Sonam, reggae junkies and many more – this journey is all about rolling with the punches.</p>
<p>Special Lassi is one part funny, two parts crazy and a whisper of wistful – for the best things are ephemeral and a lust for life is a dangerous thing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>International bestseller</p>
<p>For decades, Israel’s renowned security arm, the Mossad, has been widely recognized as the best intelligence service in the world. In Mossad, authors Michael Bar-Zohar and Nissim Mishal take us behind the closed curtain with riveting, eye-opening, boots-on-the-ground accounts of the most dangerous, most crucial missions in the agency&#8217;s 60-year history.</p>
<p>These are real, true Mission: Impossible stories brimming with high-octane action – right from the breath-taking capture of Nazi executioner Adolph Eichmann to the recent elimination of key Iranian nuclear scientists. If you are fascinated by the world of international espionage, intelligence, and covert “Black-Ops” warfare, then you will definitely find that the Mossad makes for some electrifying reading.</p>
