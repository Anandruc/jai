										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An inspiring story that is a testament to the power of simplicity, resilience and the human spirit.</p>
<p>In Live, Laugh and Let Go, veteran entrepreneur Gul Hinduja invites readers from all walks of life to embark on an intimate journey through his life—a rich tapestry of dreams, triumphs, setbacks, joys, fears and hopes, woven together to form the extraordinary life of an ordinary man.</p>
<p>Gul’s path to becoming a global businessman was far from easy, but his unwavering embrace of life and his ability to forge deep, meaningful relationships across the world have made him a beacon of joy and inspiration to all who meet him.</p>
<p>Born into the renowned Hinduja family, Gul chose to lead a humble life. This choice, far from limiting him, has been his compass, guiding him through life&#8217;s most intricate mazes with a clear mind, positive attitude and unshakeable grace.</p>
<p>This book is more than just an autobiography; it is Gul Hinduja’s legacy to the world. Through his story, he encourages readers to believe in their dreams, to embrace every day as a celebration, and to never retire from the pursuit of their passions.</p>
