										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They invented our base-ten number system and zero that are now used globally, carefully mapped the sky and assigned motion to the Earth in their astronomy, developed a sophisticated system of medicine with its mind-body approach known as Ayurveda, mastered metallurgical methods of extraction and purification of metals, including the so-called Damascus blade and the Iron Pillar of New Delhi, and developed the science of self-improvement that is popularly known as yoga. In the modern era, thinkers and scientists as diverse as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Johann Gottfried Herder, Carl Jung, Max Müller, Robert Oppenheimer, Erwin Schrödinger, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Henry David Thoreau have acknowledged their debt to ancient Hindu achievements in science, technology, and philosophy.</p>
<p>Ancient Hindu Science is well documented with remarkable objectivity, proper citations, and a substantial bibliography. It highlights the achievements of this remarkable civilization through painstaking research of historical and scientific sources. The style of writing is lucid and elegant, making the book easy to read. This book is perfect for all students and others interested in the developments of science throughout history and among the ancient Hindus, in particular.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written for readers with no background in quantum physics, Levy contemplates the deeper philosophical underpinnings of quantum physics, exploring the fundamental conditions it provokes:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is implied by the concept of no “objective reality?”</li>
<li>How are we participating via our consciousness in creating our experience of a reality that quantum theory itself describes as “dreamlike?”</li>
<li>What are the implications for us in our everyday lives that as quantum theory reveals that what we call reality is more like a dream that we had previously imagined?</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Physics for Geeks, Rhett Allain, a physics professor and Wired’s popular Dot Physics blogger, combines pop culture with everyday science for an entertaining explanation of physics. Finding intriguing questions buried in familiar movies and TV shows, video games, viral videos, and news hooks, Physics for Geeks walks readers through the fascinating, easy-to-understand answers from a physics perspective.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does a mirror reverse left to right, but not top to bottom?</li>
<li>How many dollar bills would it take to stack them to the moon?</li>
<li>What if everyone on Earth jumped at the same time?</li>
<li>Is Angry Birds using real physics?</li>
<li>Does a heavier truck make a better snow plow?</li>
</ul>
<p>With illustrations, basic equations, and easy-to-read graphs and diagrams, each chapter not only covers the most popular subjects from Allain’s blog, like lightsabers and house-sized ducks, but uses those fun, and at times, mind-boggling questions to teach basic physics concepts. What better way to explain the nature of light than to consider how The Hobbit, Gollum could see in the dark?</p>
