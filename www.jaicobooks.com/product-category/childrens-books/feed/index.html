										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When they started their first restaurant in 1940, the McDonald brothers had no idea their enterprise would one day become synonymous with American pop culture. With a basic menu and an ordering system based around burgers and milkshakes, McDonald’s grew from one company to more than 31,000 in just 50 years. Seventy-five years on, the company continues to offer meals that are affordable and comforting, if not necessarily healthy, and their service is quick and efficient.</p>
<p>They’ve had their share of battles and controversies but, as you will see in The Story of McDonald’s, the company is taking its original offerings around the globe by successfully finding new ways around local palates. McDonald’s is surging ahead leaving behind a trail of competitors and copies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Story of Disney is about two brothers and their animated dreams that went on to become a billion-dollar enterprise. From movies to theme parks, the Disney brothers – Walt and Roy – always tried to give their audience something new; something memorable; something big. Walt in particular was a man of innovation and is credited with many firsts in the motion picture industry – first-ever cartoon with sound, first colour cartoon, the animated feature film… to list but a few.</p>
<p>Originally a film studio, the Walt Disney company is now involved in nearly every aspect of the entertainment world. This book is a roller-coaster ride through the legacy of the creator of many a dear cartoon and animated character of our times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nicknamed Coke, a company that churns out a revenue of USD 24 billion a year had a rather humble beginning. When local pharmacist John Pemberton brewed a mix of fruit syrup, extracts from cola nut, cocoa leaf and several other ingredients to create a tonic, little did he know he was creating a brand which would later become synonymous with having a good time – frothing with fun and frolic.</p>
<p>The Story of Coca-Cola is the chronicler of a journey that started in 1886 at the back of a shop in Atlanta, Georgia, to become the global leader in the beverage industry; through their shares of wars, scandals, ups and downs. It is the story of a survivor, a world leader.</p>
