<p>It’s homicide season in Mumbai. And it’s Ganeshotsav. A sinister killer with a dark and twisted imagination is terrorizing the city with a series of chilling and gruesome murders every day. His victims are the innocent rich and famous. All celebrities or VIPs with one fault in common. The elite Crime Branch sleuths of the Mumbai Police are easily compared with London’s Scotland Yard. But there’s one thing they have never figured out – how to successfully detect crimes committed by psychopathic serial predators like rapists, pedophiles and killers in this city of 20 million. Can these cops prevent the psychopath from committing murder tomorrow when they haven’t yet detected today’s homicide?</p>
<p>Moryaa Re! is a compulsively readable and gritty crime thriller with a tight plot that could have been ripped off the headlines. Mumbai, with its glorious festivals, colorful people and capricious monsoon, provides the perfect dark and rain-spattered backdrop for murder.</p>
