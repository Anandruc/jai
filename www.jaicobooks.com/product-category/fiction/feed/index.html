										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Present in this omnibus edition, are four unabridged novels of Baker Streets most famous resident – Sherlock Holmes and his confidant and aide, Dr. Watson. The saga of their adventures begin right from the time they are first introduced to each other by a certain “young stamford” to share rooms in Baker Street, where Watson chronicled their first adventure ‘A Study in Scarlet’. ‘The Hound of Baskervilles’ is perhaps the most popular of his long stories, followed by ‘The Sign of the Four’ and ‘The Valley of Fear’.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New enlarged edition</p>
<p>The present selection is an attempt to represent the wide range and variety of Mulk Raj Anand’s short stories. The first group represents the stories of ‘lyric awareness’. As in all poetry, the themes are elemental, such as birth and death, beauty, love and childhood, and the treatment often reveals a symbolic dimension added to realistic presentation.</p>
<p>The prevailing mood of the second group of stories in this selection is of the ‘tears at the heart of things’. These stories are naturally allied to the brief tales of ‘lyric awareness’ but with a difference. Through his acute understanding of the complex social forces at work, Anand describes an India where tradition clashes with modernity.</p>
<p>The range and variety of Anand’s short stories are not only in mood, tone and spirit but also in locale, characters and form. The setting ranges from the Punjab (as in The parrot in the cage) to Uttar Pradesh (as in The Price of Bananas) and Kashmir (as in Kashmir Idyll). Both the village and the city get almost equal representation. Mulk Raj Anand’s stories are a museum of human nature. Among the Indian writers of the short story in English, he has few peers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Portuguese captain anchored his fleet near the Calicut port. He fixed his piercing gaze on the shore and stood still. This time, Vasco da Gama made up his mind to take the treasures of the Malabar Coast back with him at any cost. His priority, pepper – the Black Gold!</p>
<p>Across the sea, the Zamorin of Calicut began to panic. He knew Gama’s return meant trouble. Calicut’s relationship with the neighbouring kingdoms isn’t exactly cosy, thanks to Zamorin’s exacting trade policy. A failure at this point is not an option and that too, to a foreigner! To add to his worries, there’s a spy roaming free in his own turf, plotting revenge.</p>
<p>In the center of all this melee is the Zamorin’s pretty niece, Kunjulakshmi, harbouring her own little secret that could crumble the kingdom and start a war of doom on the coast.</p>
<p>Filled with familiar milestones from history, Anuradha’s splendid novel is accompanied by illustrations from the celebrated Artist Namboodiri.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mother, the immortal classic of Maxim Gorky, one of the world’s best-loved writers, is the story of the radicalization of an uneducated woman. From her dull peasant existence into active participation in her people’s struggle for justice. Through her work she frees herself from the cowed state into which she has been beaten, and her simple motherly concern for her son becomes a motherly concern for all oppressed.</p>
<p>To read Mother is to undergo a great emotional experience. It is a novel of strength and power, a tribute to the dignity of the individual. As one well-known literary critic puts it: “and then I came on Mother, the first of Gorky I had ever seen, and much of what I had read became thin and tasteless by comparison. It was tapestry after cotton and burlap, living, breathing people after cardboard cutouts&#8230; it was the hope and zeal of all human beings.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New reformatted edition</p>
<p>This book is a compilation of classic short stories by five great Indian writers – Raja Rao, Rabindranath Tagore, Premchand, Dr. Mulk Raj Anand and Khushwant Singh. Though not necessarily representative of the authors’ complete works, the stories have been carefully chosen to showcase their versatility and skill as storytellers. The collection covers an extraordinary range of themes, styles and settings, allowing the reader a glimpse of another world gone by. Yet, these stories seem timeless, and the characters in them show the same foibles, fears and hopes as do people in the brave new world of the 21st century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>William Shakespeare (1564-1616), a poet and playwright, is acknowledged as the greatest writer and the world’s pre-eminent dramatist. He excels in plot, poetry and wit, and his talent encompasses the great tragedies of Hamlet, King Lear, Othello and Macbeth as well as the moving history plays and the comedies such as A Midsummer Night’s Dream, The Taming of the Shrew and As You Like It with their magical combination of humour, ribaldry and tenderness.</p>
<p>Charles and Mary Lamb interweave the words of Shakespeare with their own to bring 20 of his best plays to the young reader. They collaborated on several books for children, publishing in 1807 their famous Tales from Shakespeare.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gup De Maupassant was a master of the short story. This collection reflects his remarkable diversity, with stories that vary in theme and tone, and range from tragedy and satire to comedy and farce. With a simplicity of style that masks complex philosophy, Maupassant can illuminate an entire code of values by means of a few telling details. He exposes the brutality of war and the hypocrisy it spawns, and depicts the petty limitations, the dissimulations and the vanities inherent at different levels of society. His stories are linked by a trenchant irony and by a preoccupation with the frailty of human nature and the futility of so many lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Russian novelist and moral philosopher Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) ranks as one of the world’s great writers, and his “War and Peace” has been called the greatest novel ever written. The purpose of all true creative art, he believed, is to teach. But the message in all his stories is presented with such humour that the reader hardly realises that it is strongly didactic.</p>
<p>The seven parts into which this book is divided include the best known Tolstoy stories. “God Sees the Truth, but Waits” and “A Prisoner in the Caucasus” which Tolstoy himself considered as his best; “How Much Land Does a Man Need?” depicting the greed of a peasant for land; the most brilliantly told parable, “Ivan the Fool” – these are all contained in this volume.</p>
