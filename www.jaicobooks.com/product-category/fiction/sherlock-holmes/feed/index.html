The saga of their adventures begin right from the time they are first introduced to each other by a certain “young stamford” to share rooms in Baker Street, where Watson chronicled their first adventure ‘A Study in Scarlet’. ‘The Hound of Baskervilles’ is perhaps the most popular of his long stories, followed by ‘The Sign of the Four’ and ‘The Valley of Fear’.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But not for Sherlock Holmes, who, in a stunning display of intellect and derring-do, will elude his hangman’s noose and live to fiddle, spy and ratiocinate another day.</p>
<p>Against tremendous odds, Holmes will continue to defy his enemies in four more encounters, from cracking German intelligence codes, to going against Scotland Yard and the Crown in proving the innocence of a man condemned to death for the slaying of a pregnant serving girl, to an arsenic-wielding magician, and of course, to a battle of wits with the malevolent Moriarty. Everywhere in these five finely-wrought tales, riddles and mystery hover in the air. But they are not beyond the grasp of the incomparable Holmes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, the indefatigable detective, and his assistant Dr. Watson, will track down the perpetrators through the occult underworld of Victorian London.</p>
<p>Next, on the eve of World War I, he is confronted with fraud and forgery at the Royal Navy Academy in The Case of a Boy‘s Honor. Back in London, behind the scenes of the Herculaneum Theatre in the Strand, The Case of the Matinee Idol embroils Holmes and Watson directly in an apparent on-stage murder. How did poison get into two Shakespearean goblets when only the victim, now dead, had access to them and the most likely suspect was a mile away with an unbreakable alibi?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sherlock Holmes is dead – or so most of the world thinks. His fatal plunge over the Reichenbach Falls as he struggled with his archenemy, Moriarty, has been widely reported.</p>
<p>But Holmes has escaped and is alive.</p>
<p>From 1891 to 1894, Holmes wanders through Asia. He is alone, without Watson, without Scotland Yard, armed only with his physical strength and his revered cold logic and rationality. The adventures recounted in The Lost Years of Sherlock Holmes range from Lhasa to Katmandu, from the East Indies to the deserts of Rajasthan. He confronts the tsarist agent Dorjiloff, the great art thief Anton Furer, and the mysterious Captain Fantôme. For Holmes’s fans throughout the world, the stories in The Lost Years of Sherlock Holmes fill an enigmatic missing chapter in the great detective’s career.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the year 1933 an elderly Dr John Watson is looking back over his life and his time spent with his brilliant friend and master of deduction Sherlock Holmes. He writes in a letter to the reader that he has assembled a list of seven untold adventures that span from his and Sherlock’s early years until the time of Sherlock’s retirement. Watson explains that he wishes to leave, not only his family but the public with a final compilation of adventures that he and Sherlock shared while he is still able.</p>
<p>In these seven stories Holmes and Watson are caught in the middle of multiple Government Scandals (Acquitted Client &amp; Diamond Jubilee) cold blooded murders (Poisoned Affair &amp; Saint Mary’s Murder) and Terrorist groups (The Yellow Handkerchief). As well Holmes and Watson come face to face the spirits of darkness (The Haunted Hotel) and in a story that works through over a decade of Holmes’ cases, we learn the truth about Watson’s marital life and what happened to his wife Mary after Holmes’s apparent death at Reichenbach (The Solved Problem).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this fast-paced novel set in the Victorian London, a string of heinous murders in London’s East End has Inspector Abberline of Scotland Yard baffled and his boss, Commissioner Sir Charles Warren furious that no arrests have been made of the culprit the newspapers have dubbed “Jack the Ripper”. With pressure for an arrest mounting, a reluctant Abberline calls on Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson for assistance.</p>
<p>Using a combination of intuition, luck, and good old-fashioned police work, the trail they follow leads them directly to Baron Antonio Barlucci. The wealthy Italian financier is a long time family friend of Sir Charles and a ruthless vampire. His trail of blood stretches from Paris to London and if he’s not captured soon an innocent young Italian immigrant will swing from the gallows for a murder he didn’t commit.</p>
<p>The baron, though, has other plans. He’s come to London to enlist the aid of a young American, Dr Alan Tremaine, to cure his vampirism. To complicate matters, the baron has fallen in love with Sir Charles&#8217;s niece, Abigail Drake.</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts, “Jack the Ripper” aficionados and fans of old school vampires will find something to love in this meticulously researched novel that dares cross multiple genres.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been argued that Sherlock Holmes is more famous, worldwide, than William Shakespeare and there is evidence to support the claim. The great detective is, almost certainly, the most famous fictional character of all time, and in this, the latest collection of his adventures from Doctor Watson’s old tin dispatch box, the mysteries range from the poignant tragedy of novice nun Jane Stiles to the thrilling race against time as Holmes battles to secure a fabulous legacy for his young client Andrew Newton. From the brutal serial killer known as The Mayfair Strangler to Holmes’ gruesome encounter with Catacausis Ebriosis or Spontaneous Human Combustion. From the locked-room mystery of Alexander Cavendish’s demise to the ruthless cunning of The Peddler of Death, Holmes needs all his deductive powers to unravel the clues and bring the guilty to justice. This compilation, comprising a Baker’s (street) Dozen of his adventures, re-creates the gas-lit, fog-enshrouded world of Victorian London as once more Sherlock Holmes urges, ‘Come, Watson, the game’s afoot!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent decease of one of the descendants of Dr. Watson has brought to light his personal papers. These include a number of stories that Dr. Watson suppressed at the time for various reasons. As all involved are long dead, the inheritor has agreed to the publication of a set the most interesting adventures.</p>
<p>Overall, The Lost Stories is a collection of entertaining, canonically consistent tales whose intentionally understated plots are refreshingly limited in scope, relishing in the quotidian of everyday ‘bad behavior’ – opposed to falling prey to that great pastiche writer’s temptation of crafting a short story of epic proportions populated by an abundance of big name historical figures and playing the ‘what really happened’ game where Massive Historical Event X actually hinged on Holmes’ secret intervention.</p>

<p>A brand new cache of original cases from the brilliant imagination of June Thomson displays the master of the art of deduction at his intriguing best and proves that the game is still very much afoot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Sherlock Holmes London, reputations are fragile and scandal can be ruinous. In order to protect the names of the good (and not-so-good), Dr Watson comes to the decision that his accounts of some of his friend’s most brilliant cases must never see the light of day. And so he conceals the manuscripts in an old dispatch box, deep in the vaults of a Charing Cross bank&#8230;</p>
<p>Now, outlasting the memories of those they could have harmed, these mysteries finally come to light. An aluminium crutch betrays the criminal who relies upon it for support . . . An Italian Cardinal lies dead in a muddy yard in Spitalfields . . . What do a pair of suspiciously successful gamblers have in common with the Transylvanian mind-reader, Count Rakoczi? And can Holmes and Watson outwit the jewel thief who has the nerve to steal from the King of Scandinavia?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a thrilling jaunt in the Far East, Holmes and Watson return to England to address an inheritance left by one of Watson’s relatives in Cornwall, half of which is entrusted to Sherlock Holmes.</p>
<p>Financially secure, the two are now free to spend as much time on Baker Street and the Continent as they please, and the duo find themselves as comfortable in Rome on the banks of the Tiber as they do on the Thames. As Holmes rationalizes and ratiocinates his way through adventure after adventure, from The Case of Two Bohemes to A Singular Event in Tranquebar, it is all in a day’s work, until clues surface that his great nemesis, Professor James Moriarty, might still be alive . . .</p>
<p>“There’s no way to dance around it: Ted Riccardi’s work is absolutely brilliant. It is as if he is channeling Conan Doyle. Once you’re a few pages into these stories, you would swear that these were newly discovered manuscripts, unearthed by Conan Doyle’s estate. Or, better yet, I had the feeling that I had stumbled upon some pulp magazines where Conan Doyle was still writing. Riccardi has it all down – the cadence, the language, everything. He doesn’t try to subtly update Holmes for the modern audience, either. It is as if each and every tale was written at the turn of the century, and not the twenty-first.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again the game is afoot, in these highly original stories featuring Sherlock Holmes at the height of his powers. Crossing historical fact with inventive fiction, the master of pastiche Donald Thomas plunges Holmes into London’s Siege of Sidney Street, where he ratiocinates alongside Winston Churchill in obstructing an anarchist’s assassination plot led by ‘Peter the Painter.’ In the next adventure, Holmes and Watson are confounded by the Riddle of the Zimmerman Telegram during World War I, as Holmes must employ all his wits to defeat a plan for a German-led invasion of the United States. In other mystifying tales of detection, Sherlock Holmes searches for the treasures of King John, lost in 1216. Foiling a foul extortion attempt, Holmes and Watson aid in discovering Lord Byron’s epic poem evoking his secret journey to Virginia. Finally the great detective, in a bravura performance, confronts a supernatural curse in “Lord Arthur Savile’s Crime.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Accompanied as ever by Dr. Watson, Holmes here investigates: The alleged bigamy of King George V&#8230; The theft of the Irish Crown Jewels in 1907&#8230; The bizarre circumstances of the death of President Faure of France&#8230; Such dramas are not fiction but historical reality.</p>
<p>The investigations described in this volume relate the part played by the great detective in seven major crimes or scandals of the day, some of them too damaging to the monarchy, the government or the security of the nation to be fully revealed at the time.</p>
<p>Compiled in narrative form by Dr. Watson soon after the great detective’s death, Holmes’s notes have been kept under lock and key at the Public Record Office in Chancery Lane.</p>
<p>Now, seventy years later, we can finally open the secret casebook of Sherlock Holmes.</p>
