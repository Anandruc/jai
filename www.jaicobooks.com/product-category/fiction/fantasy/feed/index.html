										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Portuguese captain anchored his fleet near the Calicut port. He fixed his piercing gaze on the shore and stood still. This time, Vasco da Gama made up his mind to take the treasures of the Malabar Coast back with him at any cost. His priority, pepper – the Black Gold!</p>
<p>Across the sea, the Zamorin of Calicut began to panic. He knew Gama’s return meant trouble. Calicut’s relationship with the neighbouring kingdoms isn’t exactly cosy, thanks to Zamorin’s exacting trade policy. A failure at this point is not an option and that too, to a foreigner! To add to his worries, there’s a spy roaming free in his own turf, plotting revenge.</p>
<p>In the center of all this melee is the Zamorin’s pretty niece, Kunjulakshmi, harbouring her own little secret that could crumble the kingdom and start a war of doom on the coast.</p>
<p>Filled with familiar milestones from history, Anuradha’s splendid novel is accompanied by illustrations from the celebrated Artist Namboodiri.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The brilliant star-reader Varahamihira, one of the famed Nine Gems of the king’s court, predicts a rare eclipse that has alarming consequences. Soon after, the scrolls carrying his predictions go missing. While the court considers how to retrieve them, they receive news of yet another disappearance ? none other than their celebrated poet Kalidasa! The kingdom erupts in an uproar.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in our own time, an adventure begins for Atisa, the teenage owner of a time-travelling flying machine! On a peaceful night in the snow-capped Himalayas, Atisa hears mysterious wails of distress through his state-of-the-art sound-catcher. In a whirlwind of events, he is transported to the midst of ancient Pataliputra and its imbroglio over the missing scrolls and poet.</p>
<p>Will Atisa save Kalidasa and the scrolls?</p>
