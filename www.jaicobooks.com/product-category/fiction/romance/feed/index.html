										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>‘They’ use these words to describe Babloo – the doctors, his family, his teachers… everyone… except Vandana. She treats him the way he wants the world to see him.</p>
<p>Mumbai… the city that defines his ultimate desires. Will it allow him the love and ‘normalcy’ he so craves?</p>
<p>Vandana… yearns for a soul mate to rescue her from the confines of the Railway Colony they all live in. Is she looking in the right place?</p>
<p>Rail Man… a fearless, real-life hero who succeeds in doing all that Babloo secretly wishes to do… is Babloo his inspiration or… is it the other way around?</p>
<p>A random twist of fate on Mumbai’s endless, serpent-like, jangling local train tracks ties all these characters together in a complex weave of love, heartbreak, and courage.</p>
<p>Babloo draws the reader into his fascinating, heart-rending journey through the twisted, choked lanes of Mumbai, into an open space where he can finally exhale, be born again.</p>
