										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mother, the immortal classic of Maxim Gorky, one of the world’s best-loved writers, is the story of the radicalization of an uneducated woman. From her dull peasant existence into active participation in her people’s struggle for justice. Through her work she frees herself from the cowed state into which she has been beaten, and her simple motherly concern for her son becomes a motherly concern for all oppressed.</p>
<p>To read Mother is to undergo a great emotional experience. It is a novel of strength and power, a tribute to the dignity of the individual. As one well-known literary critic puts it: “and then I came on Mother, the first of Gorky I had ever seen, and much of what I had read became thin and tasteless by comparison. It was tapestry after cotton and burlap, living, breathing people after cardboard cutouts&#8230; it was the hope and zeal of all human beings.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gup De Maupassant was a master of the short story. This collection reflects his remarkable diversity, with stories that vary in theme and tone, and range from tragedy and satire to comedy and farce. With a simplicity of style that masks complex philosophy, Maupassant can illuminate an entire code of values by means of a few telling details. He exposes the brutality of war and the hypocrisy it spawns, and depicts the petty limitations, the dissimulations and the vanities inherent at different levels of society. His stories are linked by a trenchant irony and by a preoccupation with the frailty of human nature and the futility of so many lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>William Shakespeare (1564-1616), a poet and playwright, is acknowledged as the greatest writer and the world’s pre-eminent dramatist. He excels in plot, poetry and wit, and his talent encompasses the great tragedies of Hamlet, King Lear, Othello and Macbeth as well as the moving history plays and the comedies such as A Midsummer Night’s Dream, The Taming of the Shrew and As You Like It with their magical combination of humour, ribaldry and tenderness.</p>
<p>Charles and Mary Lamb interweave the words of Shakespeare with their own to bring 20 of his best plays to the young reader. They collaborated on several books for children, publishing in 1807 their famous Tales from Shakespeare.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Russian novelist and moral philosopher Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) ranks as one of the world’s great writers, and his “War and Peace” has been called the greatest novel ever written. The purpose of all true creative art, he believed, is to teach. But the message in all his stories is presented with such humour that the reader hardly realises that it is strongly didactic.</p>
<p>The seven parts into which this book is divided include the best known Tolstoy stories. “God Sees the Truth, but Waits” and “A Prisoner in the Caucasus” which Tolstoy himself considered as his best; “How Much Land Does a Man Need?” depicting the greed of a peasant for land; the most brilliantly told parable, “Ivan the Fool” – these are all contained in this volume.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Panchatantra, one of the world’s greatest collections of tales, was compiled in India by a learned Brahmin named Vishnusharman, more than 2,000 years ago. These stories were meant to impart worldly wisdom to the dull-witted sons of a king, and have since travelled the world, awakening intelligence in readers across centuries.</p>
<p>Arthur Ryder, a Professor of Sanskrit at the University of California, translated the Sanskrit original into English in 1925. This re-write of the Ryder translation is aimed at today’s busy reader and the original interwoven stories are presented separately. Archaic English prose makes way for modern language. The “Principle” clearly and simply summarizes the wisdom imparted at the end of each story. Arthur Ryder’s brilliant introduction and charming verse translations remain untouched.</p>
<p>This book is a rare coming together of simple format, rich poetry, practical wisdom and lofty ideals, a vehicle to transmit the simple and timeless truths of the Panchatantra in a concise manner to a modern audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This charming collection of his prose and drama includes his most evocative works complete with his first, and only, novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, a tale of pure beauty and unadulterated decadence.</p>
<p>Also included are his fascinating short stories, like the delightful tale of The Happy Prince and the poignant satire, The Birthday of the Infanta with its much darker overtones. Among his plays are comedies such as Lady Windermere’s Fan and A Woman of No Importance, seemingly trivial but mercilessly exposing Victorian hypocrisies. The book also includes the controversial and macabre tragedy, Salomé which was designed to make his audience shudder by its depiction of unnatural passion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An enduring classic, Droll Stories offers a highly animated and entertaining portrait of life in 16th-century Europe. Jaico Classics presents its first edition of 10 lively tales by the inimitable and irreverent novelist, Honoré de Balzac.</p>
<p>Written with the author’s trademark wordplay, stories such as The Maid of Thilouse present the good-humoured licentiousness of Balzac’s times. Tales like The Merry Jests of King Louis the Eleventh and The Venial Sin that once scandalized the public now simply delight modern readers.</p>
