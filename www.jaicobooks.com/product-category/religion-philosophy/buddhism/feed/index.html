										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White Lotus is a beautiful symbol. White represents multidimensionality, because white contains all the colors of the spectrum. That is the most strange, unbelievable quality about white: it contains all the colors yet it seems to be colorless. But it contains all those colors in such synthesis, in such harmony, that they all disappear. They dissolve into oneness and that oneness is white. White represents the ultimate synthesis and harmony.</p>
<p>And the lotus also is a great symbol, particularly in the East. The Lotus represents the essential meaning of sannyas. The lotus lives in the lake and yet the water cannot touch it. it lives in the water and yet remains untouched by the water. The lotus represents the witnessing quality of your being: you live in the world, but you remain a witness. You remain in the world and yet you are not part of it. You participate and yet you are not part of it. You are in the world, but the world is not in you.</p>
<p>When you become a calm and cool observer of life you are going to laugh &#8211; not ordinarily laughter but a belly laughter like a lion’s roar. And white Lotuses will start showering on you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In The First Principle, Osho captures the unique, colorful, seemingly crazy spirit of Zen through talks on a collection of Zen stories – anecdotes of the often-bizarre interchanges between a master and disciple in the quest for truth. From these anecdotes, Osho distills Zen’s pragmatic essence for the reader and conveys an alive understanding of its message – “the first principle.”</p>
<p>Speaking to the contemporary, modern reader without robbing these old tales of their magic, charm and humor, Osho reminds us: “You are the shrine for the first principle. So the only way is to go within. Turn in. That is what meditation is all about.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Buddha was the first most active missionary in the world. He wandered from place to place for forty-five years preaching His doctrine to the masses and the intelligentsia. Till His last moment, He served humanity both by example and by precept. His distinguished disciples followed suit. Penniless, they even travelled to distant lands to propagate the Dhamma, expecting nothing in return.</p>
<p>This treatise, written by a member of the Order of the Sangha, is based on the Páli Texts, commentaries, and traditions prevailing in Buddhist countries.</p>
<p>The first part of the book deals with the Life of the Buddha, the second with the Dhamma, the Páli term for His Doctrine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Easwaran’s introduction to the Dhammapada gives an overview of the Buddha’s teachings that is reliable, penetrating, and clear – accessible for readers new to Buddhism, but also with fresh insights and practical applications for readers familiar with this text. Chapter introductions place individual verses into the context of the broader Buddhist canon. Easwaran is a master storyteller, and the introduction includes many stories that make moving, memorable reading, bringing young Siddhartha and his heroic spiritual quest vividly to life.</p>
<p>But Easwaran’s main qualification for interpreting the Dhammapada, he said, was that he knew from his own experience that these verses could transform our lives. This faithful rendition brings us closer to the compassionate heart of the Buddha.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tantrism, often misunderstood, is one of the most elaborate and colourful forms of Buddhism. Believed to have originated around the 5th-century-AD in Old Bengal, Tantric Buddhism has far more to do with the sacred than the sexual. It focuses on a particular style of meditation and ritual.</p>
<p>The Secrets of Tantric Buddhism presents translations of 46 classic texts from Caryagiti, a collection of teachings from Tantrics and Siddhas who lived during the Pala dynasty (10th and 11th century). These teachings emanate from one of the most dynamic sources of international Buddhism, at the height of its religious development.</p>
<p>A translator of Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian and Muslim classics, author Thomas Cleary provides detailed commentaries on these ancient teachings, making them fresh and contemporary.</p>

<p>In Questions from the City, Answers from the Forest, Buddhist monk and author Ajahn Sumano Bhikkhu explores the human mind and the causes behind humankind’s suffering. Written on a well-traveled, battery-powered laptop in a meditation cave in Thailand, this distillation of Buddhist wisdom answers the questions of “city” people who sought out the Buddhist in his forest retreat to obtain his answers to life’s most basic questions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For one who knows, who has no agitation,<br />
There is no karmic accumulation.<br />
—from ‘The Discourse on Being Violent’, The Book of Eights</p>
<p>Gil Fronsdal’s The Buddha before Buddhism is an elegant translation of Buddhist poems from the Atthakavagga or The Book of Eights, which is believed to be part of the Buddha’s first teachings. In this anthology, reality is not divided into a conditioned, worldly realm and an unconditioned, transcendent realm far removed from ordinary human life, which is a deviation from the usual Buddhist texts. Instead, the teachings point to peace that can be found in this life, in this world.</p>
<p>This collection of 16 poems points to a direct and simple approach for attaining peace without requiring an adherence to any specific ideology. In contrast to later Buddhist teachings that are predicated on the belief in rebirth, this book’s central theme is the joy that comes from recognizing and letting go of attachment to the illusory views that create suffering.</p>
