<p>Sri Ramana Maharshi (1879-1950) was still in his teens when he attained enlightenment through a remarkable experience, as if undergoing death of the physical body, while remaining in full consciousness. He left home for the sacred hill of Arunachala where he taught the purest form of Advaita Vedanta (non-duality) through the simple discipline of self-inquiry. His teaching, his principal instruction to all his devotes was always to meditate on the question “Who am I?”</p>
<p>In this book Arthur Osborne gives an account of the life and teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi. It has a special relevance to our age with its outlines of a religion based on the Indian scriptures which is essentially spiritual, without ceasing to be rational and ethical.</p>

<p>Swami Vivekananda is regarded as the patriot saint of modern India and an inspirer of her dormant national consciousness. His inspiring personality was well known both in India and the West. This spiritual leader of India leapt into fame at the Parliament of Religions held in Chicago, at which he represented Hinduism. His vast knowledge of Eastern and Western culture as well as his deep spiritual insight, brilliant conversation, broad human sympathy, and colourful personality evoked popular interest in Hindu philosophy.</p>
<p>He introduced the philosophy of Vedanta to the west and preached the ideal of a strength-giving and man-making religion. Service to man as the visible manifestation of the Godhead was the special form of worship he advocated.</p>
<p>In this volume Gautam Sen pieces together the representative portions of the Swami’s philosophy along with a running commentary of his own.</p>

<p>Though he is considered one of the foremost of India’s philosophers, Shankara is also one of the most misunderstood. Much of the misunderstanding of Shankara’s position may be due to the absence of a lucid presentation of his life and works in a comprehensive and readable form. This short monograph is an attempt to meet that need for the benefit of those who have no previous acquaintance with philosophy.</p>
<p>Shankara was one of the most subtle of Indian philosophers and though for him intellectual dexterity was not an end in itself, the reader will find some reasoning worthy of his steel in the following pages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sai Baba of Shirdi is a phenomenon. In all of India’s history, there has never been another like him. He is not a conventional saint. He wrote no critique of the Bhagvad Gita or the Upanishads or any other holy work. He made no pretensions to scholarship yet he had a profound insight into both Hindu and Islamic scriptures. He founded no ashram or peetham, wrote no tome, initiated no disciple to take over from him. He performed ‘miracles’ but in no manner of means to impress anyone, devotee or otherwise. Sai Baba in every way remains unique.</p>
<p>Born about 20 years before the ‘Sepoy’ mutiny in the 19th century in Marathwada, the home of medieval saints of Maharashtra, he came in his late 20’s to Shirdi, an insignificant hamlet in Ahmednagar district and spent the remaining 50 years of his life there until his mahasamadhi. Today Shirdi is a centre of pilgrimage for lakhs of Sai Baba’s devotees. This book is a complete account of his life and mission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Within this extraordinary memoir, Radhanath Swami weaves a colorful tapestry of adventure, mysticism and love. Readers follow the former Richard Slavin from the suburbs of Chicago to the caves of the Himalayas as he transforms from young seeker to renowned spiritual guide. The Journey Home is an intimate account of the steps to self-awareness and also a penetrating glimpse into the heart of mystic traditions and the challenges that all souls must face on the road to inner harmony and a union with the Divine.</p>
<p>Through near-death encounters, apprenticeships with advanced yogis, and years of travel along the pilgrim’s path, Radhanath Swami eventually reaches the inner sanctum of India’s mystic culture and finds the love he has been seeking. It is a tale told with rare candor, immersing the reader in a journey that is at once engaging, humorous and heartwarming.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreword by Klaus K. Klostermaier, PhD</p>
<p>In 1965, a seventy-year-old man—soon to be known as Prabhupada—set sail from India to America with a few books in his bag, pennies in his pockets, and a message of love in his heart. He landed in New York at the peak of the revolutionary counterculture movement of the ’60s, and went on to spark a global spiritual renaissance that led to the creation of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, which has changed millions of lives.</p>
<p>Through the depiction of Prabhupada as both an enlightened luminary and a personable, funny, and conscientious individual, Swami in a Strange Land shows why cultural icons such as George Harrison and Allen Ginsberg incorporated Prabhupada’s teachings into their lives, and why millions more around the globe embarked upon the pa th of bhakti yoga in his footsteps.</p>
<p>Carefully researched, skillfully crafted, and extraordinarily intimate, this narrative follows Prabhupada as he rises from an anonymous monk to a world-renowned spiritual leader. Set in locations as far ranging as remote Himalayan caves and the gilded corridors of Paris’s City Hall, this book traces the rise of Eastern spirituality in the West—and in particular, the rise of yoga culture and vegetarianism and the concepts of karma and reincarnation.</p>
