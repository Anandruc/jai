										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This selection of 365 Sayings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) offers an overview of Islamic faith and practices. These profound and life-enriching sayings of the Prophet have served as one of the main sources of divine guidance and law for Muslims through the ages.</p>
<p>This selection helps readers gain or renew their acquaintance with Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) who is undoubtedly one of the most influential figures in history and who serves as a role model for more than one billion Muslims across the world. His sayings represent the Islamic code of conduct governing every Muslim’s family, social, political, economic and spiritual life. His instructions have relevance for both individual and collective life. This selection thus stands out as a helpful introduction to both the Prophet and to Islamic beliefs and code of conduct.</p>
