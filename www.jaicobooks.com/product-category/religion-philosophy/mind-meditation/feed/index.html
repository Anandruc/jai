										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life today can feel so fragmented! Often we face enormous pressures both on the work front and at home. Irritable and drained at the end of a long day, we wonder what it was all about. But if we look at our choices through Easwaran’s eyes, it’s surprising how quickly we begin to discover patience, peace and meaning. In Take Your Time, Easwaran shows us through his timeless stories that we could try something different next time we’re feeling stressed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meditation is a systematic technique for training the mind, especially attention and the will, so that we can set forth from the surface level of consciousness and journey into the very depths. With meditation you train your attention, drawing together the scattered threads of what you think, say and do.</p>
<p>The Principle of Meditation is simple: You are what you think. By meditating regularly, you find yourself becoming wiser, kinder, with greater sense of purpose and connection to others.</p>
<p>This book is a complete guide to a program of meditation developed by Eknath Easwaran.<br />
— Universal and dogma-free, meditation fits within any religious practice or nonreligious philosophy; it is used by counselors and yoga teachers, as well as health and education professionals.<br />
— Eknath Easwaran taught meditation to thousands of people for over 40 years, including a course at the University of California.<br />
— Thoroughly tested, consistent and clear, the instructions in this book are all you need to start meditating.</p>
<p>With Easwaran’s help, choose words or passages that appeal to you, from one spiritual tradition or many, poetic or intellectual, lofty and inspiring or warmly practical.</p>
<p>Keep meditating, and your words or passages will become lifelines, taking you to the source of wisdom deep within and then guiding you through the challenges of daily life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feeling trapped by unwanted thoughts and emotions can seem an inevitable part of life. But Easwaran, who taught meditation for nearly forty years, shows a way to break free. Just as a fitness routine can create a strong, supple body, spiritual disciplines can shape a secure personality and a resilient, loving mind.</p>
<p>Writing as an experienced, friendly coach, Easwaran explains how we can train the mind not just during meditation but throughout the day. Working with difficult colleagues, choosing what to eat, and listening to a child’s needs are all opportunities to try out different, wiser responses.</p>
<p>To shed light on the thinking process, Easwaran takes the timeless teachings of the Buddha and other mystics and illustrates them with scenes from contemporary life. He offers practical exercises for taking charge of our thoughts, along with instruction in his own method of passage meditation. Easwaran shows how training the mind is a glorious challenge &#8211; one that brings joy and purpose to life.</p>
