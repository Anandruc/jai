										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Based on the popular TEDx talk of the same name, Consciousness: The Final Frontier takes us on a journey of self-discovery.</p>
<p>Merging the esoteric and the mundane, tapping into ancient and contemporary wisdom, and using real-life examples, Dada Gunamuktananda explores the concept of our own consciousness as part of—indeed one with—a conscious universe. He shows how to connect with the supreme teacher within us through simple and sustainable changes to our daily life. These changes include following a yogic lifestyle, practising meditation, maintaining good hygiene and health, among others.</p>
<p>This book not only puts forth the case for a conscious universe and how a life lived in consciousness leads to inner peace, love and fulfilment within oneself, but also how these positive feelings can overflow into love and compassion for all.</p>
<p>Combining philosophy and practice, Dada explains how even in times of crisis—even amidst the life challenges of today’s world—it is possible to not just survive but to thrive and strive for a better self and a better world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Right Livelihood explores ways for us to be engaged in, but not engulfed by, our work. In a world frantic to produce, possess, and consume, few of us have time to wonder if our work damages the environment; if we are making the most of our talents or simply making a living; if we truly savor our leisure time. Krishnamurti presents sage and eloquent teachings on these issues of vital concern to us all.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti has said: “Is it not necessary for each to know for oneself what is the right means of livelihood? If we are avaricious, envious, seeking power, then our means of livelihood will correspond to our inward demands and so produce a world of competition, ruthlessness, oppression, ultimately ending in war.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> There is no religion in this book. There are no rituals prescribed here. There is no deep meditation being described here and neither is there any mention to any spiritual practice. This is not a guidebook. This is not a “self-help” book. It is not going to give you “an instant formula for joy”. But it will surely make you explore your Joy for yourself in a very direct way. The simple, short snippets of daily lives connected with what Sadhguru has to say about Joy, will take you on a wonderful roller coaster ride on Joy with the Master himself. With Sadhguru’s incredible clarity of expression, his brilliant wit and sense of observation, his ability to bring the most profound aspect in a very simple and direct way, this book is for any human being who seeks to be Joyful. No matter who you are, what you are trying to do, Sadhguru’s words will touch a wonderful wave of Joy inside you and you will soon be restless to seek Joy 24&#215;7.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Life was meant to be happy. Do you believe that? It’s true. I know it doesn’t seem like it when you look around, but it’s true. Life was meant to be happy.</p>
<p>You were meant to be happy. And if you are happy, you were meant to be happier. Even if you’re very happy, you can be even happier.</p>
<p>How happy? Just how happy can you be? Well&#8230; you can be happier than God.”</p>
<p>Since the publication of his worldwide bestseller Conversations with God, Neale Donald Walsch has been telling readers that a new understanding of God can change their lives and change the world. Here is Walsch at his best with the message that not only can you be happy, but that you are meant to be happy now!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last morning star symbolizes all that is ephemeral in the world. Talking on the playful and provocative poetry of Daya, Osho takes us on a journey from the transient, outer world to the eternal, boundless world within. This is a journey of the heart – the joyous, spontaneous, and at times uncompromising way of an enlightened woman mystic.</p>
<p>“If someone clings to the last morning star, how long will their happiness last? It is like catching a bubble of water. The bubble will burst before you can even hold it. You can try in thousands of ways to make it stay, but it will not stay. And this is what we are always doing – the whole world does it. What are the things that we try to hold on to? Relationships, attachments, love, our husband or wife, sons and daughters, wealth and riches, fame, position, prestige…”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This book is a pilgrimage in search of that indefinable something that all of us, at some time or other in our lives, feel is missing – what Osho describes as our “hidden splendor.”</p>
<p>“You go on missing something – something that you had known but you have forgotten – a faded memory, a lost remembrance. And the gap is not only a gap, it is a wound. It hurts, because you had brought something with your birth into the world and you have lost it somewhere. And it seems impossible to find it in this crowded universe. But unless it happens, your life has been in vain, a misery, a suffering, a futile longing, a meaningless desire, a thirst that you know cannot be quenched.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year, a group of Isha meditators sets out on a tour of the Himalayas. Accompanying them on this journey is Sadhguru – a spiritual master considered by many to be one of the foremost living yogis on the planet.</p>
<p>This is a book for those who stayed behind. It is a chance to make a pilgrimage on the page, travelling through the unpredictable but fascinating terrain of the master’s words. Amalgamating discourses and conversations from several yatras, it is a blend of the specific and the timeless.</p>
<p>This book is not just about the Himalayas. And yet, the book would never have happened without the Himalayas. The mountains play a vital role in the text, alternately as context and catalyst, mood and metaphor. Without them, some of the questions in this book would never have been asked. Even if they sometimes seem tangential to the line of enquiry, they remain a powerful subterranean presence, eventually becoming the very bedrock of this book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written 2,500 years ago by Chinese general Sun Tzu, The Art of War is a poetic and potent treatise on military strategy still in use in war colleges around the world. Yet its principles transcend warfare and have practical applications to all the conflicts and crises we face in our lives – in our workplaces, our families, even within ourselves.</p>
<p>Thomas Huynh guides you through Sun Tzu’s masterwork, highlighting principles that encourage a perceptive and spiritual approach to conflict, enabling you to:<br />
— Prevent conflicts before they arise<br />
— Peacefully and quickly resolve conflicts when they do arise<br />
— Act with courage, intelligence and benevolence in adversarial situations<br />
— Convert potential enemies into friends<br />
— Control your emotions before they control you</p>
<p>Now you can experience the effectiveness of Sun Tzu’s teachings even if you have no previous knowledge of The Art of War. Insightful yet unobtrusive facing-page commentary explains the subtleties of the text, allowing you to unlock the power of its teachings and help prevent and resolve the conflicts in your own life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adi Shankaracharya composed a number of Vedantic works for imparting the knowledge of the Self. One of these hymns is the famous “Bhaja Govindam”.</p>
<p>‘Bhaja’ literally means ‘seek’, ‘Govindam’ means ‘the Lord’ – ‘the Truth’. The learned masters, out of deep compassion try to wake up humanity. They invite us to open our eyes to a higher dimension of living. The whole text of Bhaja Govindam in essence means ‘Wake up, seek the Lord, and stop seeking the primitive and superficial things in life.’</p>
<p>The compilation of thoughts presented in this book is applicable to one and all. Swami Sukhabodhananda in his unique style explains the verses with deep clarity and understanding.</p>
