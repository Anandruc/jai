										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Osho continues to inspire millions of people worldwide in their search to define a new approach to individual spirituality that is self-directed and responds to the everyday challenges of contemporary life. His unique perspective encompasses both the timeless wisdom of the East and the highest potential of Western science and technology, and he was named by The Sunday Times of London as one of the “1000 Makers of the 20th Century.” The American novelist Tom Robbins has called him “the most dangerous man since Jesus Christ.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bhagavad Gita : A Melody Divine<br />
Michelangelo said that inside every block of stone dwells a beautiful statue.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad Gita is a divine song that helps unravel the beauty within you. It helps you to discover the magic potency of self-governance. It enriches you from within. Carl Jung said, Who looks outside dreams, who looks inside awakes. The world converges to that rare person who has empowered himself and tapped his inner resources. Such a person achieves success effortlessly. He is happy and evolves to his full potential. Without cultivating your inner resources you feel inadequate, incomplete. It is only with inner unfoldment that you experience true power. You are not the human being going through a spiritual experience; you are the very Spirit. The Gita brings you back to the cognition of your true potential. You become a Perfect Person.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This quest has been going on for countless lives. Sometimes you call it the search for truth. But you have never known truth, so how can you lose it? And sometimes you search for God. But your meeting with Him has never taken place, so how can you be separated from Him?</p>
<p>You go in search to the temples, to the mosques, to Kashi and to Mecca; you knock on every door you come across in the hope you will find what you have lost. But as long as you do not know exactly what it is you have lost your search cannot be fulfilled. Love is the ability to experience. Love is sensitivity. Love is the experience in which all your impurities are washed away and you throw open all your doors, all your gates. Then whosoever stands at your door is no longer an enemy or a friend but a beloved, and you open your door to him.</p>
<p>When you begin to feel the whole world is yours, when you begin to see the beloved in whosoever comes to your door, when you no longer see strangers or enemies, when you begin to see only friends everywhere – when this phenomenon takes place in you, know that you have found love.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ability is an important tool in life. Ability without commitment and awareness is like a vehicle without the engine.</p>
<p>The Shiva Sutra enhances one’s awareness in a way one sees an opportunity in a difficulty and not a difficulty in an opportunity. There is an ‘outside reality’ and an ‘inside reality’ of one’s mind. There is also another dimension called ‘spiritual reality’. To harmonize all of them is a great awakening.</p>
<p>Ordinary being loves one’s own ‘psycho dramas’ of justification, proving one’s point of view, blaming, being helpless… and this leads one to a state of inner poverty. To free oneself from these lower states of poverty and see them as ‘errors in one’s thinking’ is part of being effective and experiencing inner prosperity.</p>
<p>The profound teaching of Lord Shiva introduces us to A Bigger Container where one learns to be charitable to one’s own self. This practice of making A Bigger Container is essentially spiritual.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In extraordinary visions, they experience directly a transcendent Reality which is the essence, or Self, of each created being. They teach that each of us, each Self, is eternal, deathless, one with the power that created the universe.</p>
<p>Easwaran’s translation is reliable and readable, consistently the bestseller in its field. It includes an overview of the cultural and historical setting, with chapter introductions, notes, and a Sanskrit glossary. But it is Easwaran’s understanding of the wisdom of the Upanishads, and their relevance to the modern reader, that makes this edition truly outstanding.</p>
<p>Each sage, each Upanishad, appeals in different ways to the reader’s head and heart. In the end, Easwaran writes, “The Upanishads belong not just to Hinduism. They are India’s precious legacy to humanity, and in that spirit they are offered here.”</p>

<p>The Bhagavad Gita, ‘The Song of the Lord,’ is the best known of all the Indian scriptures, and Eknath Easwaran’s reliable, readable version has consistently been the bestselling translation.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad Gita opens, dramatically, on a battlefield, as the warrior Arjuna turns in anguish to his spiritual guide, Sri Krishna, for answers to the fundamental questions of life.</p>
<p>Easwaran’s introduction places the Gita in its historical setting and brings out the universality and timelessness of its teachings. Chapter introductions give clear explanations of key concepts, and notes and a glossary explain Sanskrit terms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lord Krishna is at once historical and mythological. He is the awesome architect of His age and the illuminating mentor whose discourse, the Bhagavad Gita, is regarded as a light unto all ages. The book Krishna: A Journey through the Lands &amp; Legends of Krishna describes well known tourist places and narrates the famous legends associated with them. It also presents places that may not be known to a common man but have witnessed the glorious pastimes of Lord Krishna and associated legends. It is an innovative book that has a happy blending of a travelogue with mythological reminiscences.</p>
<p>The centres visited are placed in a setting which gives them a tinge of human emotions; brick and marble speak to the visitor and tell stories. The past and the present mingle, and the visit becomes a memorable experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bhagavad Gita is perhaps the greatest work of practical Indian philosophy. Among the various interpretations of the Bhagavad Gita, the one by Mahatma Gandhi holds a unique position. In his own words, his interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita is designed for the common man – “who has little or no literary equipment, who has neither the time nor the desire to read the Gita in the original, and yet who stands in need of its support.”</p>
<p>Gandhi interpreted the Bhagavad Gita, which he regarded as a gospel of selfless action, over a period of nine months from February 24th to November 27th, 1926 at Satyagrah Ashram, Ahmedabad. The morning prayer meetings were followed by his discourses and discussions on the Bhagavad Gita.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the game of cricket, having scored 99 runs, when a bats-man stands poised on the threshold of that much coveted century, he experiences the moment that is best associated with Ganesha.</p>
<p>Fear and uncertainty envelope him; between him and his achievement stand hurdles, both real and imaginary: a possible spin from the bowler can overwhelm him, his own anxiety can paralyze him, cheering fans can distract him. He needs divine intervention then. He needs to focus, get rid of all hurdles, perform, get the final run, and achieve what he so longs for. In other words, he needs to think of Ganapati.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Easwaran, a foremost translator of the Gita, who taught classes on it for over 40 years, the Gita’s epic battle represents the war in our own hearts and Arjuna’s anguish reflects the human condition: torn between opposing forces, confused about how to live. Sri Krishna’s timeless guidance, Easwaran argues, can shed light on our dilemmas today.</p>
<p>Placing the Gita’s teachings in a modern context, Easwaran explores the nature of reality, the illusion of separateness, the search for identity, the meaning of yoga, and how to heal the unconscious. This book is his distillation of the Gita’s teachings from the end of his life, based on talks given to his close students and published here for the first time. Easwaran shows how, through the principles of yoga and the practice of meditation, the Gita can point a way forward for us, both as individuals and in society today.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you fall within yourself, sooner or later the form will be lost, the name will be lost, because they exist only on the surface. The deeper you drown the more you come nearer to god – god as existence, not as a person.&#8221;- Osho</p>
<p>Despite being many thousands of years old. They are direct transmissions of truth – and truth is eternal, above religious dogma and tradition – but because of their antiquity, they can appear cloaked in a mysterious language, which can be hard to understand. Osho, with his fresh and sometimes irreverent approach, brings the Kenopanishad up-to-date.</p>
</div>
<p>Because Osho can so easily go beyond the intellect, his presentation of this ancient treatise is unlike anything coming from the academic world. For those familiar with exploring ideas through the intellect, this book could be an ideal way to discover what they have been missing. One can open the book to almost any page and be astonished by the brilliance of the insights.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Easwaran presents the Dhammapada as a guide to spiritual perseverance, progress, and ultimately enlightenment – a heroic confrontation with life as it really is, with straight answers to our deepest questions. We witness the heartbreak of death, for instance – what does that mean for us? What is love? How does karma work? How do we follow the spiritual life in the midst of work and family? Does nirvana really exist, and if so, what is it like to be illumined?</p>
<p>In his interpretation of Buddhist themes, illustrated with stories from the Buddha’s life, Easwaran offers a view of the concept of Right Understanding that is both exhilarating and instructive. He shares his experiences on the spiritual path, giving the advice that only an experienced teacher and practitioner can offer, and urges us to answer for ourselves the Buddha’s call to nirvana – that mysterious, enduring state of wisdom, joy, and peace.</p>
