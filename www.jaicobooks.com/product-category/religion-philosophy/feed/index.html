										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This series of questions and answers reveals the unique relationship of immense love and trust between Osho and those who ask him for guidance on their path. Osho illuminates the very essence of each question and gives his uniquely tailored responses to such topics as: the meditative qualities of the new man; the art of being fully alive; the misuse of power and how power can be used creatively. He inspires all who are courageous enough to take a step upon the unknown spiritual path. A path which, because unknown, can feel both perilous and ecstatic—as if being on the razor’s edge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talks on Ko Hsuan’s The Classic of Purity</p>
<p>“Tao seems to be the only life vision which is total. It does not deny the earth, it does not deny the sky. It accepts both, it accepts the<br />
unity of both. It says the man who has come to know spontaneous purity and stillness, who has become relaxed with the whole, with<br />
the law of the ultimate—in him heaven and earth are united. “I believe in the whole. To me, to trust the whole is the only way to be holy and to trust the whole is the only way to be whole. And when you are whole, life is bliss, life is benediction, life is a celebration.”<br />
-Osho</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For over 35 years, Osho spoke to international audiences of seekers, addressing their essential questions and concerns. The international press calls him “A 21st Century Prophet” and “an oracle of modern times.” His books and audio lectures are international bestsellers.</p>
<p>Osho himself says that he is neither a prophet nor a philosopher; he is simply sharing his own experience. The Sunday Times of London described him as “one of the 1000 makers of the 20th century” and American author Tom Robbins has called him “the most dangerous man since Jesus Christ”—both comments reflecting the profound influence of his revolutionary approach to the science of inner transformation.</p>
<p>Spoken with authority, clarity, sharpness and humor, his insights address both the timeless and timely concerns that tend to escape our notice in the clamor and overload of daily life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Based on the popular TEDx talk of the same name, Consciousness: The Final Frontier takes us on a journey of self-discovery.</p>
<p>Merging the esoteric and the mundane, tapping into ancient and contemporary wisdom, and using real-life examples, Dada Gunamuktananda explores the concept of our own consciousness as part of—indeed one with—a conscious universe. He shows how to connect with the supreme teacher within us through simple and sustainable changes to our daily life. These changes include following a yogic lifestyle, practising meditation, maintaining good hygiene and health, among others.</p>
<p>This book not only puts forth the case for a conscious universe and how a life lived in consciousness leads to inner peace, love and fulfilment within oneself, but also how these positive feelings can overflow into love and compassion for all.</p>
<p>Combining philosophy and practice, Dada explains how even in times of crisis—even amidst the life challenges of today’s world—it is possible to not just survive but to thrive and strive for a better self and a better world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Right Livelihood explores ways for us to be engaged in, but not engulfed by, our work. In a world frantic to produce, possess, and consume, few of us have time to wonder if our work damages the environment; if we are making the most of our talents or simply making a living; if we truly savor our leisure time. Krishnamurti presents sage and eloquent teachings on these issues of vital concern to us all.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti has said: “Is it not necessary for each to know for oneself what is the right means of livelihood? If we are avaricious, envious, seeking power, then our means of livelihood will correspond to our inward demands and so produce a world of competition, ruthlessness, oppression, ultimately ending in war.”</p>

<p>Sri Ramana Maharshi (1879-1950) was still in his teens when he attained enlightenment through a remarkable experience, as if undergoing death of the physical body, while remaining in full consciousness. He left home for the sacred hill of Arunachala where he taught the purest form of Advaita Vedanta (non-duality) through the simple discipline of self-inquiry. His teaching, his principal instruction to all his devotes was always to meditate on the question “Who am I?”</p>
<p>In this book Arthur Osborne gives an account of the life and teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi. It has a special relevance to our age with its outlines of a religion based on the Indian scriptures which is essentially spiritual, without ceasing to be rational and ethical.</p>

<p>Swami Vivekananda is regarded as the patriot saint of modern India and an inspirer of her dormant national consciousness. His inspiring personality was well known both in India and the West. This spiritual leader of India leapt into fame at the Parliament of Religions held in Chicago, at which he represented Hinduism. His vast knowledge of Eastern and Western culture as well as his deep spiritual insight, brilliant conversation, broad human sympathy, and colourful personality evoked popular interest in Hindu philosophy.</p>
<p>He introduced the philosophy of Vedanta to the west and preached the ideal of a strength-giving and man-making religion. Service to man as the visible manifestation of the Godhead was the special form of worship he advocated.</p>
<p>In this volume Gautam Sen pieces together the representative portions of the Swami’s philosophy along with a running commentary of his own.</p>

<p>Though he is considered one of the foremost of India’s philosophers, Shankara is also one of the most misunderstood. Much of the misunderstanding of Shankara’s position may be due to the absence of a lucid presentation of his life and works in a comprehensive and readable form. This short monograph is an attempt to meet that need for the benefit of those who have no previous acquaintance with philosophy.</p>
<p>Shankara was one of the most subtle of Indian philosophers and though for him intellectual dexterity was not an end in itself, the reader will find some reasoning worthy of his steel in the following pages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sai Baba of Shirdi is a phenomenon. In all of India’s history, there has never been another like him. He is not a conventional saint. He wrote no critique of the Bhagvad Gita or the Upanishads or any other holy work. He made no pretensions to scholarship yet he had a profound insight into both Hindu and Islamic scriptures. He founded no ashram or peetham, wrote no tome, initiated no disciple to take over from him. He performed ‘miracles’ but in no manner of means to impress anyone, devotee or otherwise. Sai Baba in every way remains unique.</p>
<p>Born about 20 years before the ‘Sepoy’ mutiny in the 19th century in Marathwada, the home of medieval saints of Maharashtra, he came in his late 20’s to Shirdi, an insignificant hamlet in Ahmednagar district and spent the remaining 50 years of his life there until his mahasamadhi. Today Shirdi is a centre of pilgrimage for lakhs of Sai Baba’s devotees. This book is a complete account of his life and mission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Osho continues to inspire millions of people worldwide in their search to define a new approach to individual spirituality that is self-directed and responds to the everyday challenges of contemporary life. His unique perspective encompasses both the timeless wisdom of the East and the highest potential of Western science and technology, and he was named by The Sunday Times of London as one of the “1000 Makers of the 20th Century.” The American novelist Tom Robbins has called him “the most dangerous man since Jesus Christ.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White Lotus is a beautiful symbol. White represents multidimensionality, because white contains all the colors of the spectrum. That is the most strange, unbelievable quality about white: it contains all the colors yet it seems to be colorless. But it contains all those colors in such synthesis, in such harmony, that they all disappear. They dissolve into oneness and that oneness is white. White represents the ultimate synthesis and harmony.</p>
<p>And the lotus also is a great symbol, particularly in the East. The Lotus represents the essential meaning of sannyas. The lotus lives in the lake and yet the water cannot touch it. it lives in the water and yet remains untouched by the water. The lotus represents the witnessing quality of your being: you live in the world, but you remain a witness. You remain in the world and yet you are not part of it. You participate and yet you are not part of it. You are in the world, but the world is not in you.</p>
<p>When you become a calm and cool observer of life you are going to laugh &#8211; not ordinarily laughter but a belly laughter like a lion’s roar. And white Lotuses will start showering on you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bhagavad Gita : A Melody Divine<br />
Michelangelo said that inside every block of stone dwells a beautiful statue.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad Gita is a divine song that helps unravel the beauty within you. It helps you to discover the magic potency of self-governance. It enriches you from within. Carl Jung said, Who looks outside dreams, who looks inside awakes. The world converges to that rare person who has empowered himself and tapped his inner resources. Such a person achieves success effortlessly. He is happy and evolves to his full potential. Without cultivating your inner resources you feel inadequate, incomplete. It is only with inner unfoldment that you experience true power. You are not the human being going through a spiritual experience; you are the very Spirit. The Gita brings you back to the cognition of your true potential. You become a Perfect Person.</p>
