										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The events of his pilgrimage from Jerusalem to India were recorded by Buddhist historians. To this day he is known and loved throughout the East as Saint Issa.</p>
<p>For the first time Elizabeth Clare Prophet brings together the testimony of four eyewitnesses of these remarkable documents. With the thoroughness of a determined disciple turned detective she tells the intriguing story of the international controversy that arose when the manuscripts were first discovered in 1887 by Nicolas Notovitch – how experts “proved” they did not exist, only to have them rediscovered in this century by Swami Abhedananda, Professor Nicholas Roerich, and Mme Elisabeth Caspari.</p>
<p>Now you can read in one volume the chronicles and legends of what Jesus did and said in India, Nepal, Ladakh, and Tibet prior to his Palestinian mission – and the heartwarming personal accounts of those who made the trek to the Himalayas and brought back the most revolutionary message of our time.</p>
