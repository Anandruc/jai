										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Reformatted Edition</p>
<p>Diet Cure For Common Ailments covers the whole gamut of ailments which can be cured by proper food habits and regulation of one’s life, without recourse to medicinal treatment. The book is based on the theories and fundamentals of nature cure that go to preserve health and vitality and regain these when lost. It will undoubtedly be a boon not only to laymen but also to nature cure practitioners as a reference guide because of its practical utility.</p>
<p>Nature cure has carved a niche in the realm of curative sciences in our country and abroad, though the protagonists of the drugless healing system have included many other unorthodox treatments in their curative disciplines. Nature cure, through its correct application brings about amazing changes that baffle the practitioners of modern medicine, devoid as it is of the crippling side-effects of drug treatment. The all-pervading truth is that nature alone possesses the power of healing. There are not many institutions which cater to this system. Hence, many patients cannot take advantage of it. Dr. Bakhru’s book in this revised edition with complete treatment charts and illustrations will serve as a useful guide to those who wish to treat themselves through this system at home.</p>

<p>More than five billion cell phones are currently in use, and that number increases every day. Yet, the latest research ties cell phone radiation to lowered sperm counts, an increased risk of Alzheimer’s, and certain types of cancer. What are cell phone companies doing to increase product safety? And how far will they go to protect their interests?</p>
<p>In Disconnect, Devra Davis, a National Book Award finalist, offers a clear and compelling account of the sea change that has taken place in way physicists and biologists think about radiation in the microwave spectrum. Synthesizing the cautionary advice of leading experts in bioelectromagnetics and neuroscience, Davis explains the simple safety measures that we must take – before it’s too late.</p>

Long-lasting weight loss can be achieved only by changing the way you eat.</p>
<p>To reach your ideal weight, you must move away from diets to eating right. Move away from fads to healthy habits. Thin people stay thin because these habits are embedded in their subconscious and are a part of their daily routine.</p>
<p>Don’t Diet will help you identify 50 stay-thin habits – spread across mind, body and lifestyle – and give you workable cues to adopt them easily. With the help of these cues, you too can stay fit and happy. And of course, thin.</p>
