										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What if creating deeper, meaningful relationships is easier that you think it is?</p>
<p>We want people in our lives we can trust, confide in and turn to when life gets tough – people who not only appreciate our gifts but who are also fully aware of our flaws and failures, yet want to be with us anyway.</p>
<p>The good news is that forming fulfilling bonds with your spouse, friends, kids and coworkers is not only attainable, it is what you were made for!</p>
<p>In The Power of Relationships, bestselling author John Ortberg shows us how to overcome obstacles and create the kind of tender, affectionate relationships we all crave. You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to recognize and respond to bids for connection</li>
<li>How to get past the fear of intimacy</li>
<li>How to sidestep common relationship pitfalls</li>
<li>How to deal with rejection</li>
</ul>
<p>Nurturing relationships of course take time, but it’s definitely worth it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sex is never an easy subject to talk about. And that, perhaps, is why most people know so little about it. LET’S TALK about GUYS, GIRLS and SEX takes a light-hearted yet illuminating stance and starts a very important dailogue.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">The journey from teenage to adulthood is often the most daunting. And to make it even more complicated, there is heaps of seldom-verifiable information online. Can you catch AIDS by having lunch with a HIV positive friend? What is an erection? Is this love or just lust? What are the different contraceptives available in the market? How does one get pregnant?</span></p>
<p>Targeted at young adults and their parents, each chapter starts with a story that makes the topic easy to relate to. Author Swati Shome uses her years of experience with young adults to open the channels of communication. Everything you need to know about the mystery that surrounds sex lies within these pages.</p>
<p>So come on&#8230; Let’s talk!</p>

<p>Conceiving a child is one of life’s big dreams, involving both body and soul. Many mothers treasure memories such as their pregnancy, childbirth, and the moment when they finally held their baby. What if the baby himself could remember his time in the womb and his own birth? Perhaps little children might still remember. With that in mind, in 2000 the author conducted a survey of 79 mothers with children aged from 2 to 7 years. The results were beyond such memories. In the survey they also asked how the children reacted when they talked about their memories of being in the womb.</p>
<p>When one mother asked her child, “Why didn’t you move very much inside my tummy?” the child answered, “Because you said ‘It hurts’. I stayed still because I felt sorry for you, Mommy.”<br />
(Boy – 4 years 9 months)</p>
