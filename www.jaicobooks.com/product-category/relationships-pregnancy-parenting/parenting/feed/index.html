										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When will my baby first smile? How much of my two-year-old’s speech should I be able to understand? When will my child know how to ‘play nicely’? Or tie shoelaces? Or catch a ball?</p>
<p>Young children develop at a dizzying rate, constantly reaching new milestones. Of course, each child is different but many parents will want to know if their baby or toddler is developing as expected. Written by a practising GP, The First 5 Years provides clear guidelines for what to expect during each stage of this precious time in your child’s life.</p>
<p>It shows how children learn through play and provides practical, imaginative tips on dealing with the challenges they can bring.</p>
<p>Discover how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deal with the difficulties of tantrums, toilet training and fussy eating</li>
<li>Turn everyday situations, such as tidying up or going to the park, into fun, learning events</li>
<li>Use playdough to develop manual dexterity</li>
<li>Help your child on their first day at school or nursery</li>
</ul>
<p>Practical and reassuring, The First 5 Years will be a constant companion as your child grows up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Translation by Seika Smith</p>
<p>Conceiving a child is one of life’s big dreams, involving both body and soul. Many mothers treasure memories such as their pregnancy, childbirth, and the moment when they finally held their baby. What if the baby himself could remember his time in the womb and his own birth? Perhaps little children might still remember. With that in mind, in 2000 the author conducted a survey of 79 mothers with children aged from 2 to 7 years. The results were beyond such memories. In the survey they also asked how the children reacted when they talked about their memories of being in the womb.</p>
<p>When one mother asked her child, “Why didn’t you move very much inside my tummy?” the child answered, “Because you said ‘It hurts’. I stayed still because I felt sorry for you, Mommy.”<br />
(Boy – 4 years 9 months)</p>
