										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreword by Steve Forbes</p>
<p>Are you the authority in your field? Are you recognized as a stand-out thought leader, a published author, a keynote speaker, or a media personality? Are you viewed as a commodity? A hard-working expert who is a commodity and has to compete on every level, including price?</p>
<p>One thing is for certain: if you are an entrepreneur, CEO, or professional who is frustrated with the traditional approach to marketing and wants to grow your business and make a bigger impact, this book will show you how to use the Authority Marketing System to create a clear and trackable blueprint to shift yourself from a commoditized expert to a highly visible Authority. In this book you will learn what Authority Marketing is and how to use it to grow your business.</p>
<p>Authority Marketing isn’t about ego or attention—it’s about accelerating the speed of trust so you are viewed not as an expert with something to sell, but as a thought leader with important insight to teach. Start growing your Authority today!</p>
