										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This book will be a total waste of time if you are</p>
<ul>
<li>Excited about slogging in a job for the rest of your life</li>
<li>Gratefully handing over your income to your mummy-papa to manage</li>
<li>Certain of winning the lottery or receiving a huge inheritance</li>
<li>A financial expert with your investments completely sorted</li>
</ul>
<p>Finance is intimidating, the products are complicated, salespeople are pushy, and the jargon is confusing. Well, not anymore! Three Pigs to Financial Freedom guides you on everything you need to know—how much money you need to be financially free, the accounts you need to open, the products you should buy, how much you should invest in them, and where you should get them. Using an incredibly easy and practical system, the book humorously demystifies financial planning in the Indian context. Best of all, you don’t need any knowledge of managing money to get started!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the story of the birth and growth of India’s most valued Bank – HDFC Bank Ltd – against the backdrop of the new bank movement in India that started in 1994 when the Reserve Bank of India opened up the sector to introduce competition and to force banks to be efficient and more productive.</p>
<p>Many books have tried to give meaning to India’s recent history, to put it in the larger context of a complicated and confounding society, but this effort stands out because it does something that has been difficult to attempt – retelling the story of modern India through the lens of business.</p>
<p>Given the author’s familiarity with bankers, policy makers and central bankers, this fast-paced, jargon-free book, written for a wide audience, brings to life an engrossing and sweeping tale of 21st century India, with all its foibles and charms.</p>
