										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nicolas Darvas was not a stock market professional trading on inside information. He was one of the highest paid dancers in show business. Yet he was able to make himself a millionaire several times over by his unique investment approach. Unlike other so-called systems, it worked regardless of whether the market rose or fell.</p>
<p>When news of Darvas’s fantastic profits and methods leaked, he was featured in Time magazine. He then was persuaded to write this book, which became an instant hit—selling nearly 200,000 copies in eight weeks.</p>
<p>Many of the companies talked about in this book no longer exist. Many of the stocks are no longer traded. Nevertheless, the basic principles are as sound as ever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In The Geometry of Wealth, behavioral finance expert Brian Portnoy delivers an inspired answer based on the idea that wealth, truly defined, is funded contentment. It is the ability to underwrite a meaningful life. This stands in stark contrast to angling to become rich, which is usually an unsatisfying treadmill.</p>
<p>At the heart of this groundbreaking perspective, Portnoy takes readers on a journey toward wealth, informed by disciplines ranging from ancient history to modern neuroscience. He contends that tackling the big questions about a joyful life and tending to financial decisions are complementary, not separate, tasks. These big questions include:<br />
• How is the human brain wired for two distinct experiences of happiness? And why can money “buy” one but not the other?<br />
• Why is being market savvy among the least important aspects of creating wealth but self-awareness among the most?<br />
• Can we strike a balance between pushing for more and being content with enough?</p>
<p>This journey memorably contours along three basic shapes: A circle, triangle, and square help us visualize how we adapt to evolving circumstances, set clear priorities, and find empowerment in simplicity. In this accessible and entertaining book, Portnoy reveals that true wealth is achievable for many—including those who despair it is out of reach—but only in the context of a life in which purpose and practice are thoughtfully calibrated.</p>

<p>There has never been a better time to be an ordinary investor. With more opportunities, lower costs and a more level playing field than ever before, you really can go head to head with the professionals. But there remains one big difference between Wall Street and the individual investor: technique and experience.</p>
<p>Superinvestors provides both in a new way. It takes an in-depth look at 20 of the best investors in the last 200 years and shows the reader how to adopt a similar approach. These investors have been picked for a variety of criteria, including their investing excellence, the different ways in which they made money and, above all, for what they can teach individual investors.</p>
<p>Ranging from David Ricardo, who made a fortune by correctly predicting the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo, to the patient, value-orientated approach of Warren Buffett, this book a treasure trove of success stories, cautionary tales, legendary stock picks and world-beating strategies. It will fascinate and inspire investors of every level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ian Murphy examines the job of a trader and their relationship with the market—how to survive where so many others have failed. He reveals the habits of serious professionals including essential procedures such as the ‘Eight Checks’ and the ‘Nine Filters’ which should be employed by all traders before a single penny is placed in the market. Most importantly, he explains how the ‘Five Limits of Risk’ allow us to embrace the dangers at the heart of trading, so we can face the market with confidence and clarity.</p>
<p>Using psychology—the key to trading success—we see how the concept of a trading edge is overrated and misunderstood. Buddhist techniques for working with the mind which can be profitably employed in the market have also been discussed here.</p>
<p>The author shares three consistently profitable trading strategies which expose opportunities inherent in the market and demonstrates how to leverage those opportunities. Way of the Trader provides a wealth of practical tools for those who wish to make a living from the markets.</p>
