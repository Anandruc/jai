										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each generation produces its “literature of power.” This type of writing literally has the power to change the reader’s life. In this tradition. In The Greatest Salesman In The World is destined to influence countless lives.</p>
<p>Here is the legend of Hafid, a camel boy of two thousand years ago, and his burning desire to improve his lowly position in life. To prove his potential ability, he is dispatched from Bethlehem by his master, the great caravan merchant, Pathros, to sell only one robe. He fails and instead, in a moment of pity, gives the robe to warm a newborn baby in a cave near the inn.</p>
<p>Hafid returns to the caravan in shame but is accompanied by a bright star shining above his head. This phenomenon is interpreted by Pathros to be a sign from the gods, and he gives Hafid ten ancient scrolls, which contain the wisdom necessary for the boy to achieve all his ambitions.</p>
