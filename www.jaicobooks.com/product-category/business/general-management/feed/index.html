										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The three cardinals of Gandhian Philosophy – truth, love and non-violence – are so coherent, cohesive and co-focal that the absence of even one breaches the wholesomeness of the structure. However, all these elements ought to be understood across a much wider plane and in a much deeper sense beyond the threshold of their common meanings.</p>
<p>The importance of the human factor in contemporary management can be seen in its finest form in Gandhian Management. Gandhiji’s humanitarian canvas was so global, and clarion call for natural justice so intense that he became an institution by himself much before the world discovered this reality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China remains one of the hottest business environments in the world, with the country’s unexpected and sustained growth rate continuing even in these tumultuous economic times. Many corporations and countless entrepreneurs are looking to capitalize on this, but often with a limited understanding not just of Chinese business, but of Chinese businesspeople and how they think.</p>
<p>Inside the Chinese Business Mind: A Tactical Guide for Managers focuses on helping business leaders and managers get an understanding of the core values and beliefs that drive business in China. It is a perfect tool for helping business people gain insights into the vastly different, surprisingly diverse Chinese business culture. The book also provides profound learning for leaders and their values and behaviors in the process.</p>
<p>At the core of Inside the Chinese Business Mind is an in-depth study which gathered responses from over 200 business leaders. Going beyond the scope of traditional guidebooks, the study incorporates elements of psychology, philosophy, and business, resulting in a fascinating portrait of the Chinese people, one that finds clear distinctions in behaviors and priorities across different regions, among various age groups, and within other demographic categories. The specific information will help business leaders develop the kind of cultural awareness that leads to greater opportunities and stronger relationships in China, at home, and within themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sahara: The Untold Story is based on painstaking research to demystify India’s most secretive and largely unlisted conglomerate, the Sahara India Pariwar. It also delves into the group’s ongoing legal battle with the market regulator.</p>
<p>Entrepreneur Subrata Roy, the guardian angel of the group, whose feet are touched by everybody in the Pariwar, wants to reach out to a million lives and feels impeded and shuttered in by regulations. So the clash with the regulators was inevitable. But when a regulator slams one door, maverick Roy opens another. This play has been on since 1978, when Sahara was set up.</p>
<p>Roy is well known for glamour and his association with film stars, cricketers and politicians. He exudes patriotism, with a statue of Bharat Mata (the presiding deity of the group) on a chariot driven by four fierce-looking lions adorning his headquarters in Lucknow. He is the Robin Hood of a country where only 35% of the adult population has access to formal banking services. This India and its millions of illiterate poor depositors stand in awe and admiration of him. But does he also exploit them? Do these poor people actually keep money with him or are they fronting for others?</p>
<p>Excerpt from the Sahara India Pariwar disclaimer<br />
‘The book at best can be treated as a perspective of the author with all its defamatory content, insinuation and other objections, which prompted us to exercise our right to approach the court of law in order to save the interest of the organization and its crores of depositors and 12 lakh workers.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s must-have products add up to one giant success story. iPod, iPad, iTunes, App Store…the list goes on.</p>
<p>So what’s their secret? What makes Apple the most innovative company on the planet?</p>
<p>The answer: Apple does exactly the opposite of what any other company would do.</p>
<p>Unlike the competition, Apple develops devices and programs by concentrating on a small number of functions. Forget complex market analyses. Forget asking customers to help develop products. And, unlike Google and other internet giants, it wants you to pay for them. Apple combines traditional business thinking with the endless opportunities of the digital age.</p>
<p>In this brave new world where brands and products are dragged into the opinion marketplace, What Would Apple Do? (short and sweet, just how Apple would do a book) brilliantly and concisely reveals how you can learn from Apple to develop compelling business ideas and market them successfully.</p>

<p>Everybody’s Business is a journey through the business world. We meet the companies that are driving business forward by mobilising to tackle the challenges we all face. At its heart, this is a story of businesses doing what they do best: delivering products and services that people need, creating jobs and finding new ways to solve old problems. It’s a story of people taking the initiative, and finding inspiration in the positive impact of their actions.</p>
<p>We see how some of today’s leading companies are realising that lasting success comes from having a purpose broader than making a profit. They know that business should benefit customers, employees, suppliers, neighbours and the wider world, as well as shareholders. Enduring value comes from making business work for everybody.</p>
