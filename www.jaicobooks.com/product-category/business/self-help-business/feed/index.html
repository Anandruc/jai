										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idea of being successful is an attractive dream that fills us with positive emotions, whereas the actions required to get ahead of the game at work, in relationships, in sports, or in any other area are often difficult and lengthy.</p>
<p>What do we need to do to close this gap between what we want and what we have to do to achieve it? We need goal-oriented motivation. This is the fuel that takes us across the long and often uncertain bridge to our desired destination in life.</p>
<p>The trick is to learn how to develop this kind of motivation on demand, sustain it through the difficult periods, and instill it so intricately into our daily life that it becomes a part of us.</p>
<p>All of that and more is available in this all-new cutting-edge book, The Science of Motivation, from personal development expert Brian Tracy and his co-author Dan Strutzel.</p>

Known for his foresight, he constantly sought to present cutting-edge gadgets in the market and create a demand for it. Removed from the company he founded in a twist of fate, he propelled Pixar Entertainment as a forerunner in digital animation. His constant efforts to improve technology and design reveal his humility and passion for the work that he was doing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By age 16, thousands more hours will have been spent by most of us in some form of disagreement with those in our extended social networks.</p>
<p>As a species, we’re well practised at falling out with each other. We may even have a gene for it – certainly, some of us seem to be gifted.<br />
When it comes to finding resolutions, however, things don&#8217;t come quite so naturally: as much as 90% of all interpersonal conflicts never reach agreement.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
<p>I Don’t Agree is a fascinating exploration of new, powerful and surprising solutions to an ancient problem: why we disagree so much. It shows how to sidestep our animosities and get great things done, despite our differences.</p>
<p>Underpinned by cutting-edge research and academic thinking (as well as fascinating real-life case studies and easy-to-use tools), author and marketeer Michael Brown reveals the eye-opening secrets that can lead to better leadership, stronger teams, swifter promotions, more effective collaboration, better organisational culture – as well as radically improving your life outside of work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No matter who you are or what your background is, you are worthy of a content and fruitful life. All you need to do is be aware of the manipulations of your mind. Human mind can be a powerful tool if you know how to use it.</p>
<p>With the help of many real-life examples and anecdotes, bestselling author Anand Patkar delves into the intricacies of human mind to illustrate that contrary to popular belief it is possible to rewire your mind to make it work for you.</p>
<p>Patkar equates one’s chaotic state of mind to a monkey to explain the havoc it can cause if left unchecked. In the same way, he compares the inborn wisdom we all possess to “Moorti Within”,<br />
a God-like quality that unfortunately gets eclipsed when a person is in the grip of a cocktail of emotions.</p>
<p>So who’s really in charge of your life? Monkey or Moorti?</p>
<p>Read on to know how to regain control of your supreme consciousness to lead a life full of peace and happiness each day.</p>
