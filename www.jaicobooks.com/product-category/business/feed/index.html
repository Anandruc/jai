										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nicolas Darvas was not a stock market professional trading on inside information. He was one of the highest paid dancers in show business. Yet he was able to make himself a millionaire several times over by his unique investment approach. Unlike other so-called systems, it worked regardless of whether the market rose or fell.</p>
<p>When news of Darvas’s fantastic profits and methods leaked, he was featured in Time magazine. He then was persuaded to write this book, which became an instant hit—selling nearly 200,000 copies in eight weeks.</p>
<p>Many of the companies talked about in this book no longer exist. Many of the stocks are no longer traded. Nevertheless, the basic principles are as sound as ever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreword by Dr Alexander Elder</p>
<p>Trading is a stressful occupation, with mental and emotional traps on every side. Our instincts drive us to self-destruction: holding plummeting stocks in the hope of a sudden recovery, or obsessing over the minute-to-minute movements of our holdings.</p>
<p>What if there were a trader who knew how to avoid these traps and could teach us to trade from a place of inner calm and peace of mind?</p>
<p>Peter Castle has been a successful trader in financial markets for almost 30 years. He also happens to be a Zen monk. Peter’s unique perspective gives him unrivalled insight into how the wisdom of Zen can empower us to master our minds and achieve success in the markets.</p>
<p>Many guides to using Zen avoid clear prescriptions and rely instead on cryptic quotes. In THE ZEN TRADER, Peter demystifies both trading and Zen, using decades of experience, sharing dozens of real-life examples, and explaining clearly the systems that enable mastery of both disciplines.</p>
<p>He teaches us how to limit distraction, focus attention, detach from problematic emotions, be true to ourselves, and embrace the unlimited opportunities that exist in our professional and personal lives.</p>
<p>Following Peter’s wisdom, you too can become a ZEN TRADER..</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In The Geometry of Wealth, behavioral finance expert Brian Portnoy delivers an inspired answer based on the idea that wealth, truly defined, is funded contentment. It is the ability to underwrite a meaningful life. This stands in stark contrast to angling to become rich, which is usually an unsatisfying treadmill.</p>
<p>At the heart of this groundbreaking perspective, Portnoy takes readers on a journey toward wealth, informed by disciplines ranging from ancient history to modern neuroscience. He contends that tackling the big questions about a joyful life and tending to financial decisions are complementary, not separate, tasks. These big questions include:<br />
• How is the human brain wired for two distinct experiences of happiness? And why can money “buy” one but not the other?<br />
• Why is being market savvy among the least important aspects of creating wealth but self-awareness among the most?<br />
• Can we strike a balance between pushing for more and being content with enough?</p>
<p>This journey memorably contours along three basic shapes: A circle, triangle, and square help us visualize how we adapt to evolving circumstances, set clear priorities, and find empowerment in simplicity. In this accessible and entertaining book, Portnoy reveals that true wealth is achievable for many—including those who despair it is out of reach—but only in the context of a life in which purpose and practice are thoughtfully calibrated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this enthralling account, we follow Buffett’s investment deals over the decade from 1989 to 1998, as Berkshire shares jumped 14-fold from $4,700 to $68,000 and its market cap grew from $5 billion to $100 billion.</p>
<p>This was a period of Buffett’s career when he was approaching normal retirement age. But far from slowing down, he was just hitting his stride. Buffett was as driven as ever to seek out great companies at good prices. By studying the decision-making that went into his investment deals, and the successful and unsuccessful outcomes, we can learn from Buffett and become better investors ourselves.</p>
<p>In this decade, Buffett made investments in Wells Fargo, USAir, American Express, The Shoe Group, Helzberg Diamond Shops, RC Willey, FlightSafety International, Dairy Queen, NetJets, and General Re.</p>
<p>For each of these deals, investing expert and Buffett historian Glen Arnold dives into unprecedented detail to analyse the investment process and the stories of the individuals involved. Arnold’s engaging, lucid style transports the reader to the time and place of the deals, to truly appreciate how Buffett was operating</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you know what it meant when bankers said “Chinese cuisine”, “Punjabi food”, or “Gujarati thali”?</p>
<p>An RBI governor let down his hair at his<br />
farewell dinner to swing to “Lungi Dance” from the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Chennai Express.</p>
<p>The chairman of a financial institution relied on “signals” from the idol of a goddess kept in his cabin for clearing loan proposals.</p>
<p>A public sector bank chairman liked to munch hot chilies with his lunch. A kitchen help was deputed to mop up the sweat from his bald head!</p>
<p>Roller Coaster is a string of such stories and revelations from the country’s foremost banking journalist&#8217;s affair with the industry—even though banks were not ideal partners for such liaisons. He has seen the industry and dramatis personae grow over two and a half decades, first as a rookie reporter, then as an editor and a columnist, and, finally, as an author.</p>
<p>The book brings to light the lives of India’s commercial and central bankers. But it does not discuss their successes, failures, or the ever-evolving dynamics of monetary and fiscal policies. It&#8217;s about their persona, warts and all—how they are as leaders, how they evolved, and how they changed the culture and ethos of the Indian banking sector.</p>
<p>Dive in for inside information about some of the biggest names associated with Indian banking—Uday Kotak, Sandeep Bakhshi, Amitabh Chaudhry, V. Vaidyanathan, as well as C. Rangarajan, Bimal Jalan, Y. V. Reddy, D. Subbarao, Raghuram Rajan, Urjit Patel, Shaktikanta Das, and many more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adityanama offers an exclusive look into the legendary banker Aditya Puri’s life through the eyes of his better half, Smiley Puri.

<p>Smiley provides readers a window into the famously discreet banker’s personal life and professional journey dotted with stories revealing Aditya’s sense of humour, his love for food and pranks, his management style, and his commitment to family and friends.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each generation produces its “literature of power.” This type of writing literally has the power to change the reader’s life. In this tradition. In The Greatest Salesman In The World is destined to influence countless lives.</p>
<p>Here is the legend of Hafid, a camel boy of two thousand years ago, and his burning desire to improve his lowly position in life. To prove his potential ability, he is dispatched from Bethlehem by his master, the great caravan merchant, Pathros, to sell only one robe. He fails and instead, in a moment of pity, gives the robe to warm a newborn baby in a cave near the inn.</p>
<p>Hafid returns to the caravan in shame but is accompanied by a bright star shining above his head. This phenomenon is interpreted by Pathros to be a sign from the gods, and he gives Hafid ten ancient scrolls, which contain the wisdom necessary for the boy to achieve all his ambitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strategy execution has far more potential for value creation than does strategy formulation. This book offers a complete tool kit to help firms achieve world-class strategy execution status. It focuses on initiative management, aligning executive, operating, and support processes with market rhythms, the seven stages of business growth, and time-phasing initiatives with the competitive realities of the firm’s environment. It also demonstrates how to track the ripple effects of change throughout the organization.</p>
<p>Numerous exhibits portray tools that can be used by firms to develop world-class strategy execution prowess. A glossary of new terms and new definitions of familiar terms is included, along with a diagnostic survey that a firm can use to assess its current status regarding its world-class strategy execution abilities. The authors also provide a 10-S model of management imperatives that updates the McKinsey 7-S model from the 1980s. If a firm has been bogged down for too long in strategy formulation, now is the time to begin the execution phase – using this book as a starting point will give any organization the advantages it needs to launch this initiative successfully.</p>
