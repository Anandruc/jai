										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strategy execution has far more potential for value creation than does strategy formulation. This book offers a complete tool kit to help firms achieve world-class strategy execution status. It focuses on initiative management, aligning executive, operating, and support processes with market rhythms, the seven stages of business growth, and time-phasing initiatives with the competitive realities of the firm’s environment. It also demonstrates how to track the ripple effects of change throughout the organization.</p>
<p>Numerous exhibits portray tools that can be used by firms to develop world-class strategy execution prowess. A glossary of new terms and new definitions of familiar terms is included, along with a diagnostic survey that a firm can use to assess its current status regarding its world-class strategy execution abilities. The authors also provide a 10-S model of management imperatives that updates the McKinsey 7-S model from the 1980s. If a firm has been bogged down for too long in strategy formulation, now is the time to begin the execution phase – using this book as a starting point will give any organization the advantages it needs to launch this initiative successfully.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chanakya, who lived in India in the 4th Century BC, was a leadership guru par excellence. The treasure of his teachings can be found in his book, The Arthashastra, which deals with good governance based on ideal leadership.</p>
<p>The concept of the ideal nation in The Arthashastra, called Saptanga, holds that there are seven pillars of a kingdom: Swami, Amatya, Janpada, Durg, Kosha, Dand, Mitra iti Prakritya. For centuries, Indian rulers have used this concept as a model of successful government.</p>
<p>In this path-breaking book, Chanakya’s 7 Secrets of Leadership, author Radhakrishnan Pillai delves into Chanakya’s Saptanga with the real-life example of D. Sivanandhan. Former Director General of Police, Maharashtra, and the archetype of an able administrator, Sivanandhan shares his guidelines for effective management, highlighting those that make him a dynamic leader.</p>
<p>In Chanakya’s 7 Secrets of Leadership, theory meets practice, academic research meets vast experience in police supervision and an age-old formula is revealed in a modern-day success story. Together, Pillai and Sivanandhan bring Chanakya’s model to life.</p>
<p>Anyone can use the seven secrets of leadership to run a kingdom effectively. Apply them in your life, and the magic of Chanakya’s wisdom will transform you into the ideal leader.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Business the Kishore Biyani Way explores this stellar entrepreneur’s leadership traits and unique qualities that led over seemingly insurmountable obstacles and set up his sprawling empire.</p>
<p>Influential leaders have the vision, farsightedness, persistence and conviction to take that one step forward and make a giant leap of a difference.</p>
<p>What makes Biyani’s story unique is that he understood and caught on to the aspirations of Indians at the time of slow-moving economic liberalization. He created and encouraged consumption and made people realize that the desire to buy for sheer pleasure was not bad.</p>
<p>Biyani does not fit into any archetypal model of leadership – he is reserved, dresses inconspicuously, is self-effacing and not in the habit of making glib presentations. However, he has a definite vision; he understands retail and consumption and he knows what people want. Most of all, he displays the all-important quality of persistence to see his ideas through.</p>
