										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this enthralling account, we follow Buffett’s investment deals over the decade from 1989 to 1998, as Berkshire shares jumped 14-fold from $4,700 to $68,000 and its market cap grew from $5 billion to $100 billion.</p>
<p>This was a period of Buffett’s career when he was approaching normal retirement age. But far from slowing down, he was just hitting his stride. Buffett was as driven as ever to seek out great companies at good prices. By studying the decision-making that went into his investment deals, and the successful and unsuccessful outcomes, we can learn from Buffett and become better investors ourselves.</p>
<p>In this decade, Buffett made investments in Wells Fargo, USAir, American Express, The Shoe Group, Helzberg Diamond Shops, RC Willey, FlightSafety International, Dairy Queen, NetJets, and General Re.</p>
<p>For each of these deals, investing expert and Buffett historian Glen Arnold dives into unprecedented detail to analyse the investment process and the stories of the individuals involved. Arnold’s engaging, lucid style transports the reader to the time and place of the deals, to truly appreciate how Buffett was operating</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator is the bestselling story of Jesse Livermore or “Boy Plunger”—the famous American investor and security analyst who made his millions from the stock market. Edwin Lefèvre tracks the exploits of Livermore as he won and lost tens of millions of dollars playing the stock and commodities markets during the early 1900s.</p>
<p>With riveting accounts of Livermore’s experiences as one of the most influential speculators on Wall Street, the book is rich with trading wisdom and rules that Livermore imparts through Lefèvre. The book’s enduring appeal rests in Livermore’s view that the market is made up of people and the excesses of the market reflect mass psychology. According to him the mistakes of individuals are frequently the result of the inability to control fear and greed. Thus, the views and lessons of Livermore continue to be relevant to every new generation of investors and traders. This book is considered a classic in business writing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the relentless growth of passive investing—investors blindly following the market—the opportunities for a smart investor to profit by betting against the crowd should be greater than ever.</p>
<p>Yet, being a contrarian is hard work. You need to adopt a sceptical mindset: a flexible mode of thinking that allows you to stand back and spot when the market’s view of the world is badly out of touch with reality—and the best way to profit when reality eventually reasserts itself.</p>
<p>In The Sceptical Investor, John Stepek, Executive Editor of MoneyWeek, pulls together the latest research on behavioural finance, and examples from well-known contrarian investors, to offer practical techniques to help you spot opportunities in common investment situations, from turnaround plays to bubbles and busts, that others in the market miss.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>George Gilder—the peerless visionary of technology and culture explains why Silicon Valley is suffering a nervous breakdown and what to expect as the post-Google age dawns.</p>
<p>The Age of Google, built on big data and machine intelligence, has been an awesome era. But it is coming to an end. Google’s astonishing ability to “search and sort” attracts the entire world to its search engine and countless other goodies—videos, maps, email, calendars, etc. Everything it offers is free, or so it seems. Instead of paying directly, users submit to advertising. The system of “aggregate and advertise” works—for a while—if you control an empire of data centers, but a market without prices strangles entrepreneurship and turns the Internet into a wasteland of advertisements.</p>
<p>The crisis is not just economic. Silicon Valley has pretty much given up on security. The internet firewalls supposedly protecting all those passwords and personal information have proved hopelessly permeable.</p>
<p>The crisis cannot be solved within the current computer and network architecture. The future lies with the “cryptocosm”—the new architecture of the blockchain and its derivatives. Enabling cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, NEO and Hashgraph, it will provide the internet a secure global payments system, ending the aggregate-and-advertise Age of Google.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley, long dominated by a few giants, faces a “great unbundling,” which will disperse computer power and commerce and transform the economy and the Internet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreword by Nandan Nilekani</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">“Tamal has enthusiastically documented the epiphany that HDFC Bank’s leadership had in starting out on their digital journey. India is set for seismic changes to day-to-day banking over the next few years and banks who don’t commit to fully re-engineering their practice around becoming a technology company that delivers real-time, contextual banking experiences will wither on the vine. HDFC Bank has made a solid start on this journey, but the final chapter has not yet been written.”</span></p>
<p>Brett King, Founder, Moven and bestselling author of Bank 4.0</p>
<p>The seeds of change were sown in September 2014, when HDFC Bank MD Aditya Puri went to Silicon Valley to meet the brightest tech minds in the world. By the time he got back, he knew exactly what needed to be done.</p>
<p>It was time for a revolution. Instead of waiting to be disrupted by fintech companies, HDFC Bank went all out to disrupt itself, recasting its role and scope on a scale that has never been attempted before.</p>
<p>In one of the biggest transformations ever undertaken in any business, HDFC Bank wants to become a platform facilitating a financial experience.</p>

In The Behavioral Investor, psychologist and asset manager Daniel Crosby examines the sociological, neurological and psychological factors that influence our investment decisions and sets forth practical solutions for improving both returns and behavior.</p>
<p>Readers will be treated to the most comprehensive examination of investor behavior to date and will leave with concrete solutions for refining decision-making processes, increasing self-awareness and constraining the fatal flaws to which most investors are prone.</p>
<p>The Behavioral Investor takes a sweeping tour of human nature before arriving at the specifics of portfolio construction, rooted in the belief that it is only as we come to a deep understanding of “why” that we are left with any clue as to “how” we ought to invest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreword By Morgan Housel</p>
<p>In The Laws of Wealth, psychologist and behavioral finance expert Daniel Crosby offers an accessible and applied take on a discipline that has long tended toward theory at the expense of the practical. Readers are treated to real, actionable guidance as the promise of behavioral finance is realized and practical applications for everyday investors are delivered.</p>
<p>Crosby presents a framework of timeless principles for managing your behavior and your investing process. He begins by outlining 10 rules that are the hallmarks of good investor behavior, including ‘Forecasting is for Weathermen’ and ‘If You’re Excited, It’s Probably a Bad Idea’. He then goes on to introduce a unique new classification of behavioral investment risk that will enable investors and academics alike to understand behavioral risk in a coherent and comprehensive manner.</p>
