										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Second edition</p>
<p>Includes four colour rare photos.</p>
<p>Sachin: Born to Bat by veteran journalist Khalid A-H Ansari and edited by Clayton Murzello is a unique ode to contemporary cricket’s finest batsman.</p>
<p>Despatches to MiD DAY, one of Asia’s leading newspapers, from some of the world’s most famous names in cricket writing – Ayaz Memon, Harsha Bhogle, Ian Chappell, Mike Coward, Peter Roebuck and other luminaries – grace the pages of this book.</p>
<p>Tributes from cricket’s most famous personalities including Tendulkar’s Team India teammates and coaches make this publication invaluable in helping cricket enthusiasts understand what makes Sachin the peerless champion he is.</p>
<p>The book also captures critical moments of Tendulkar’s wondrous cricketing career from photographers who have followed him throughout his distinguished career.</p>
<p>Until his recent retirement, Padma Shri Khalid A-H Ansari was the guiding force of MiD DAY Infomedia Ltd which publishes the newspaper (in two languages from Mumbai, New Delhi, Bangalore and Pune), the Inquilab Daily and other publications. He was publisher of the magazine Sportsweek, which he started in 1968 to champion the cause of Indian sport and sportsmen until 1989, when he took up an assignment abroad. The author of three earlier books, he covered the Kargil war in 1999, the NAM conference in Harare and the CHOGM summit in the Bahamas. He was also a member of the Indian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in 1989 and published the Earth Times, the official paper for the 1994 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. He has the distinction of having covered nine Olympic Games going back to Munich ’72 and is a recipient of several honours and awards.</p>
<p>Clayton Murzello is MiD DAY’s Group Sports Editor and has been a journalist since 1988. He is a recipient of two Sports Journalists Federation of India (SJFI) awards for excellence in journalism. He has co-authored a book on cricket anecdotes with former Test cricketer Sandeep Patil.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jaico Cricketwallah Series</p>
<p>Yuvraj had flair, power and a dazzling range of strokes that had critics and fans heaping encomiums on him. While he may not have quite lived up to early expectations, especially in Test cricket, Yuvraj has been brilliantly devastating in limited overs cricket, winning countless matches on his own.</p>
<p>But, there is more to the Yuvraj story than just his exploits on the pitch. There has been no more stirring saga in modern Indian sport than his comeback to international cricket after a year-long fight with cancer that had threatened to finish his career prematurely.</p>
<p>His six sixes in one over, off Stuart Broad in the 2007 T20 World Championship, is testimony to Yuvraj’s innate batting prowess, though this comes with a vexing poser – just why could he not replicate such form in Tests too? Perhaps, considering his new vigour, that time is now.</p>
<p>Ayaz Memon, one of India’s most prolific journalists, brings with him 33 years of experience in sports writing. He started his career covering sports and went on to edit newspapers like Mid-Day, Bombay Times and DNA as well as magazines like Sportsweek. Ayaz was also sports editor for the Times of India and the Independent at various stages. He is currently consulting editor with NewsX.</p>

<p>On the football field of a beautiful small town in the Chhota Nagpur region, young schoolboy Mahendra Singh Dhoni was a goalkeeper&#8230;</p>
<p>From here on, the story of Dhoni has been nothing short of magical. Not only did he become captain of a successful Indian cricket team, he moulded that captaincy to his own image, with his strength, conviction and daring strategies.</p>
<p>Everything about MS Dhoni, from his early years to his trajectory towards stardom, from his fearless and indomitable batting skills to his courageous captaincy is here in this biography of one of India’s most recognizable cricketing icons. Not for nothing is he known as Captain Cool, for Dhoni brought home cricket’s most coveted trophies to India, from the World Cup to the inaugural T20 Championship.</p>
<p>In the words of Ian Chappell, after India’s World Cup victory, “Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s polished performance as skipper, where he pushed, prodded and cajoled his side into peaking at the right time, has shown he’s not only the best leader in the game, but also one of the finest of the last 30 years.”</p>

<p>‘When India won the Cricket World Cup in 2011, an abiding image from the celebrations was of the Indian cricket team carrying Sachin Tendulkar on their shoulders around Wankhede stadium. Tendulkar was not the captain of the team and the victory had been a team effort. But for the players, the victory was a gift to a man, arguably India’s greatest cricketer and inarguably one of the very greatest in the world.’</p>
<p>Sachin Tendulkar’s story may have been told many times, but it never stops delighting the cricket fan. In the 25 years that Tendulkar has played cricket, there is almost no existing batting record that he has not broken, or no impossible record that he has not set. He has even changed the way money and endorsements entered the game. At the same time, his incredible batting skills have kept him rooted in the fine traditions of cricket.</p>
<p>Some say that one runs out of words when describing Sachin Tendulkar’s prowess and achievements. Others may more emphatically claim that there simply aren’t enough words to talk about this incredible cricketer.</p>
