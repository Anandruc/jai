										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine’s most popular comedic actor was an unlikely president of his country. And now, even more improbably, Volodymyr Zelensky has become the world’s most celebrated statesman. Who is he? How did he become the international hero of our time?</p>
<p>Zelensky: The Unlikely Ukrainian Hero Who Defied Putin and United the World is a compelling account of this fascinating, enigmatic leader. Covering Zelensky’s childhood, family history, and astonishing transformation from TV celebrity to first Jewish president of Ukraine, this book tells you what you need to know about the newest star of the world stage.</p>
<p>No one has been more surprised by Zelensky’s power to inspire and mobilize his countrymen and the world than Vladimir Putin, who expected Russia’s conquest of its beleaguered neighbor to be the work of an afternoon. Outfoxed and isolated, Putin is not the first person to have underestimated the former comedian with a spine of steel.</p>
<p>Foreword by Rebekah Koffler, US intelligence expert &amp; author</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The human brain is hard-wired with a primal aversion to killing. Amid the horror of war even the best-trained soldiers can forget their training. Vast effort and countless sums have been spent in the attempt to keep our men fighting. Military psychologist Leo Murray argues that the real question is: How do we make the enemy stop fighting?</p>
<p>Weaving together intense first-hand accounts of combat with the hard science of tactical psychology, Murray offers a compelling insight into how war affects the human mind. War Games is both a powerful glimpse through the eyes of our soldiers and an urgent reminder that the future of modern warfare lies in understanding how the enemy thinks.</p>
<p>Fascinating and often chilling, this is the story of how psychology wins wars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The amazing story told firsthand by Gad Shimron in Mossad Exodus is now the subject of a new movie called Red Sea Diving Resort.</p>
<p>In 1977, Israel’s Mossad spy agency was given an assignment far different from its usual cloak and dagger activities. It was ordered by then Prime Minister Menachem Begin to rescue thousands of Ethiopian Jewish refugees in Sudan. No stranger to action in enemy countries, the agency established a covert forward base in a deserted holiday village in Sudan, and deployed a handful of operatives to launch and oversee the exodus of the refugees to the Promised Land, by sea and by air, in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>This book offers a thrilling firsthand account of how the operation was put in place, and how the Mossad team in Sudan brought it off, despite great personal risk, running a partying vacation spot, Arous Holiday Village, for wealthy tourists by day as they stole through the Sudanese desert to rescue desperate refugees by night. Author Gad Shimron was one of the agents based at Arous. Enhanced by his wide-ranging historical observations and his crisp, incisive prose, this is at once an entertaining read and a powerful tale of idealistic heroism.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE MOSSAD: Six Landmark Missions describes the clandestine missions that were defining moments in the evolution of the Mossad, including its pursuit of the Black September terrorists who murdered Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games, its acquisition on the high seas of yellowcake uranium for Israel’s undeclared nuclear weapons program, and its role in bringing to justice Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann.</p>
<p>The agency’s more questionable deeds are also covered, among them the assassination of civilian scientists associated with Iraq’s nuclear energy program and the abduction of Israeli citizen Mordechai Vanunu, who, like Edward Snowden, has been variously depicted as a principled whistleblower and an unscrupulous traitor. Taken together, the missions discussed in this volume illustrate the Mossad’s character, creativity and courage, while acknowledging the problematical moral dimensions of its operations.</p>

Apart from keeping America safe, these agencies play an important role in keeping peace between countries, making the Unites States the Big Brother. Working together, American intelligence agencies are today helping the U.S. battle terrorism and other threats in 130 countries on 6 different continents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Only hours after the nation of Israel was established on May 14, 1948, five neighboring Arab nations attacked, hoping to wipe out the new country. The attackers had far more soldiers and weapons than Israel but underestimated how much information Israeli spies had already gathered about the Arab nations’ military capabilities and strategies. The war quickly turned in Israel’s favor. Israel’s survival from 1948 to today has depended on its maintaining a well-established intelligence network to gather secret data, carry out covert operations, and counter terrorism. At the heart of this network is the Mossad, a shadowy organization charged with keeping Israel safe from outside enemies by any means necessary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even in peaceful times, spies need to use both modern espionage tools and old-fashioned spying techniques to uncover or protect state secrets. Modern spies face diverse situations including discovering animals with embedded chips to monitor activity in enemy territory or go through intercepted communications such as e-mails, voice messages and telephone conversations. Although there have been several technological developments in spying tools available, they come with their own limitations like drone weapons being unable to distinguish between terrorists and peaceful civilians. Take a peek into the world of corporate espionage in organizations zealously protecting their trade secrets through cases such as Proctor &amp; Gamble spying on Unilever to stay ahead of competition.</p>

Officers of the Oprichnina dressed all in black and rode black horses. They terrorized the Russian people, killing thousands whom they blamed for made-up acts of treason. Many rulers after Ivan also created their own security forces to spy on Russians at home or living outside the country. The Russian security forces of the 20th and 21st centuries—known at different times as the Cheka, NKVD, KGB, and SVR—have added to a long tradition of power, fear, and secrecy that began more than 400 years ago.</p>
