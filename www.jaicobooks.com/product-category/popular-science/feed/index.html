										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stephen Hawking is widely believed to be one of the world’s greatest minds: a brilliant theoretical physicist whose work helped to reconfigure models of the universe and to redefine what’s in it. Imagine sitting in a room listening to Hawking discuss these achievements and place them in historical context. It would be like hearing Christopher Columbus on the New World.</p>
<p>Hawking presents a series of seven lec-tures—covering everything from big bang to black holes to string theory—that capture not only the brilliance of Hawking’s mind but his characteristic wit as well. Of his research on black holes, which absorbed him for more than a decade, he says, “It might seem a bit like looking for a black cat in a coal cellar.”</p>
<p>Hawking begins with a history of ideas about the universe, from Aristotle’s determination that the Earth is round to Hubble’s discovery, over 2000 years later, that the universe is expanding. Using that as a launching pad, he explores the reaches of modern physics, including theories on the origin of the universe (e.g., the big bang), the nature of black holes, and space-time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At last, science and the soul shake hands. Writing in a style that is both lucid and charming, mischievous and profound, Dr. Amit Goswami uses the language and concepts of quantum physics to explore and scientifically prove metaphysical theories of reincarnation and immortality.</p>
<p>Dr. Goswami helps you understand the mysteries of the quantum physics model of reality and the long-held beliefs of spiritual and religious traditions. They are not only compatible but also provide essential support for each other. The result is a deeply enriched worldview that integrates mind and spirit into science. Consciousness, not materiality, is the primary reality.</p>

It is an antidote to the moral sterility and mechanistic approach of scientific materialism and is the clearest approach to understanding our universe. In short, quantum physics is indeed the theory of everything.</p>
<p>Goswami and his friends and colleagues discuss how quantum physics affects our understanding of Zen thoughts, feelings, and intuitions, dreams and their meaning, quantum reincarnation, and the spiritualization of economics and business, politics and education, and society itself.</p>
<p>The Everything Answer Book has a wealth of information for those interested in the new physics to those captivated by the spiritual implications of the latest scientific breakthroughs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>International Bestseller</p>
<p>Albert Einstein–the father of modern physics proposed the theory of relativity. Even today, scientists find evidence supporting his theories while conducting research with advanced equipment.</p>
<p>He wrote this book “to give an exact insight into the theory of relativity to those readers who, from a general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics.”</p>
<p>While the theory of relativity enriched astronomy and physics during the 20th century, technology today is getting ahead because of Einstein. Relativity: The Special and the General Theory caters to those interested in understanding the conceptual basics of scientific and technological advancements that Einstein proposed, in simple terms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Given the fervent renewed appreciation for the contributions Albert Einstein has bestowed on humanity, physicist and popular science writer Barry Parker dedicates a book to explaining in the clearest possible terms to the broadest possible audience the meaning and beauty of Einstein’s theories.</p>
<p>While tracing the story of Einstein’s life, Parker seizes on the crucial groundbreaking theories that Einstein envisioned. Through Parker&#8217;s eloquence, eye for detail, and clever use of Einsteinian cartoons and vivid illustrations, he enables the reader to see and appreciate for perhaps the first time the full meaning and scope of Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity and General Theory of Relativity. Parker then guides the reader to the next step in Einstein&#8217;s revelations: the possibility of time travel. Parker’s incomparable gift for language captures Einstein’s uniqueness, singular brilliance, and stunning theories.</p>
<p>The clarity of the writing coupled with the many illustrations will drive home the point why so many consider Einstein to be the greatest scientist who ever lived and Time magazine named Albert Einstein “Person of the Century.”</p>

Each chapter considers a separate question and ends with either an answer or, if there is insufficient evidence, a ‘best guess’ answer.</p>
<p>For every question addressed here—be it time travel, multiple universes, intergalactic travel, or the end of the world—the author has tried to exhaust all possibilities before arriving at a conclusion. Everyone will have their own opinion but one thing is certain—<br />
Mysteries of the Universe will fascinate, educate, and stimulate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bestselling author Leonard Shlain explores the potential for humankind through the life, art, and mind of the first true Renaissance Man, Leonardo da Vinci. His innovations as an artist, scientist, and inventor are recast through a modern lens, with Shlain applying contemporary neuroscience to illuminate da Vinci’s creative process. No other person in human history has excelled in so many areas of innovation: Shlain reveals the how and the why.</p>
<p>Shlain theorizes that Leonardo’s extraordinary mind came from a uniquely developed and integrated right and left brain, which offers a model for how we too can evolve. Using past and current research, Leonardo’s Brain presents da Vinci as the focal point for a fresh exploration of human creativity. With his lucid style and remarkable ability to discern connections among a wide range of fields, Shlain brings the reader into the world of history’s greatest mind.</p>
