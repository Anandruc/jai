										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SPEECHES THAT CHANGED THE WORLD covers speeches about power and equality. These include recurring themes such as politics and diplomacy, war and peace, freedom and justice, civil rights and human rights. What they all have in common is the rhetoric: the power of persuasion.</p>
<p>The speeches reflect historic events of one of the most cataclysmic centuries as told by its heroes, villains, martyrs and monsters. Josef Stalin and Mahatma Gandhi speak side by side with Nelson Mandela, Joseph McCarthy, the Kennedy brothers and Fidel Castro. Speeches by George W. Bush and Arundhati Roy show conflicting views of our modern world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No soldier wants to die listening to his own screams as his blood ebbs away in the dirt. That is a cruel end, likely to make his brothers-in-arms throw down their weapons and flee in blind terror. In some instances, though, death is preferable if it means not being dragged off and having your still-beating heart torn from your chest. Never listen to the cacophony of war, only listen for orders and press on, no matter what happens.</p>
<p>The second millennium of mankind has been characterised by almost incessant warfare somewhere on the face of the globe. BATTLES THAT CHANGED THE WORLD serves as a snapshot of the development of warfare over the past 1,000 years, illustrating the bravery and suffering mankind has inflicted upon itself in developing what we call the ‘Art of War’.</p>
<p>Here military historian Anthony Tucker-Jones selects twenty battles that illustrate the changing face of warfare over the past thousand years—from the Viking shield wall to long bows and knights, the emergence of gunpowder and finally the long-range faceless warfare of today. This is a look at the killing game and its devastating impact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Continent of Circe, the result of Nirad C. Chaudhuri’s lifetime effort to understand the nature of things Indian, describes the human situation in India after Independence. In the process of research, he worked exhaustively with Indian ethnic communities. His account has the kaleidoscopic quality of a motion picture. It links all historic events from the Aryan migration up to Nehru’s death in a coherent though shifting perspective, while revealing that the grip of established tradition on all communities has not relaxed.</p>
<p>The highlight of this book is undoubtedly the author’s imaginative interpretation of the Hindu personality based on original sources. Chaudhuri’s language is forceful and expressive, and his arguments are well-defined and lucid.</p>
<p>This book is one of this controversial author’s most compelling and authoritative works—a landmark in Indian literary history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New enlarged edition</p>
<p>Chanakya was undoubtedly ancient India’s finest political strategist and thinker. But up to this point in time, this political luminary’s views on morality have remained obscure.</p>
<p>Chanakya’s brand of wisdom is ageless and immutable. This volume forcefully impress upon one, the need and the permanence of a moral code. Chanakya expounds his views with amazing foresight and clarity. The book has a large smattering of pithy observations on women, family life, human relationships, moral conduct and spirituality. His startling prophecies, meaningful reflections on everyday living and hardheaded axioms, make this book a rich repository of profundity and reason.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This novel was simultaneously serialized in the Sunday supplements of three Gujarati Dailies: Samkaleen of Bombay, Jansatta of Ahmedabad and Loksatta of Vadodra. In this book the author tries to make an ardent effort to understand yet another enigmatic facet of human life. The tussle between the father and the son was the most poignant and pathetic story of their lives. When Gandhi, who was busy attending meetings and conferences where the fate of forty crore Indians was to be decided often found headline in a newspaper screaming – Police Arrested Drunk Harilal For Creating A Scene On The Road, and sometimes Harilal himself from the dais of the fundamentalist Muslim organization’s meeting – ‘I shall continue fighting till Ba and Bapu embrace Islam.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Gothic Revival architectural style, innovatively adapted to local conditions, was introduced to 19th century Bombay by Governor HBE Frere. Famous architects, theorists and prominent Indians of the era assisted him in the realization of his vision for Bombay as the country’s first city. Tracing the evolution of its distinctive architectural style, Christopher London reveals the fascinating history of a developing metropolis.<br />
Lavishly illustrated with colour photographs as well as rare archival material, and drawing visual comparisons with both contemporary and medieval European models, Bombay Gothic presents a comprehensive perspective of Victorian architecture in Bombay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hampi is one of the most beautiful and evocative of all historical sites in south India. Austere yet grandiose, it was established as the seat of the Vijayanagara empire in the mid-14th century, a time when art and architecture flourished. Contemporary chroniclers from Persia, Italy, Portugal and Russia visited the empire during this period and left glowing accounts of a city that was conquered by Sultanate troops in AD 1565, pillaged for six months, and abandoned.<br />
Hampi Vijayanagara examines the temples renowned for their florid ornamentation, intricate carvings, magnificent pavilions, stately pillars and a wealth of iconographic and traditional depictions. The book also includes site plans and three-dimensional reconstructions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The magnificent monuments of Gulbarga, Bidar and Bijapur in northern Karnataka are manifestations of a vibrant culture that flourished under the rule of the Bahmani and Adil Shahi sultans during the 14th to 17th centuries. The wealth of these rulers derived from the lucrative trade routes that traversed the Deccan plateau, while the splendour of their courts owed much to an open immigration policy by which gifted individuals from other parts of India, as well as from the Middle East and Central Asia, were encouraged to settle.<br />
Though the Bahmanis were supplanted partly by the Adil Shahis at the turn of the 16th century, and the latter were annihilated by the Mughal invasion of the Deccan in the 1680s, their capital cities preserve many splendid buildings. These include the imposing fortresses of Gulbarga and Bidar, the grand audience halls and ornate residential apartments in Bidar and Bijapur, the mosques and Sufi shrines in Gulbarga, and the beautifully decorated royal tombs on the outskirts of Bidar and Bijapur. For more adventurous travellers there are the abandoned ruins of Firuzabad and the decaying pleasure resort at Kumatgi.<br />
All these monuments and sites are described and profusely illustrated in this guidebook, the first ever to be published for this region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The town of Badami, the nearby villages of Aihole and Pattadakal, and the pilgrimage site of Mahakuta, in the Malprabha valley of central Karnataka, are celebrated for their magnificent rock-cut shrines and structural temples. These Hindu and Jain monuments are associated with the Early Chalukyas who reigned over this part of the Deccan during the 6th–8th centuries. Together with a profusion of magnificent sculptures, mostly found in situ, these shrines and temples may be considered among the earliest, best preserved vestiges of temple art in India.<br />
This guidebook, the first ever for the Badami region, is authored by a scholar whose PhD was on Early Chalukya architecture. The text is illustrated with regional and town maps, building plans, and more than 130 splendid coloured photographs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This guidebook is the first to showcase the magnificent monuments of the twin cities of Golconda and Hyderabad, the successive capitals of the Qutb Shahi sultans and the Asaf Jahis, the latter usually referred to by their title as the Nizams. Golconda’s massive fortifications and defensive gateways, as well as its decaying palaces, pavilions, stores and barracks give the best possible idea of one of India’s wealthiest and grandest royal cities in the 16th-17th centuries. These buildings may be compared with the courtly and civic monuments in Hyderabad, many of them sponsored by the Nizams who ruled this part of India up to the middle of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Marika Sardar provides the essential historical background for all these vestiges, together with their religious and cultural context. She then describes the most important monuments of Hyderabad, beginning with the old city, and then progressing to the different urban zones of the modern city, ending with the churches and club that still stand in the British cantonment of Secunderabad to the north. For those with more time and interest, the author also describes the rugged hill citadel of Golconda, now partly engulfed by the rapidly expanding suburbs of one of India’s most vital metropoles. Profusely illustrated with Surendra Kumar’s fine photographs, and handy city maps, the guidebook should prove indispensable to all visitors to Hyderabad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This guidebook focuses on four cities and sites in Maharashtra of exceptional historical importance and architectural interest. While Aurangabad is well known as a convenient base from which to reach the celebrated cave-temples at Ajanta and Ellora, the city’s tombs and mosques are hardly ever visited. Many of these were built during the 17th century, when the city served as the second capital of the Mughal Empire, taking its name from the emperor Aurangzeb who spent many years here.</p>
<p>A short distance from Aurangabad is Daulatabad. This citadel is dominated by a rugged basalt hill, the sides of which have been artificially scooped into vertical faces, beneath which are situated a number of palaces and mosques dating back to the 13th-14th centuries. The nearby small walled town of Khuldabad is celebrated for its holy Sufi shrines, inside one of which Aurangzeb himself is buried.</p>
<p>The city of Ahmadnagar, a day trip from Aurangabad, was capital of the Nizam Shahi sultans in the 16th century. From their era date a number of impressive mosques, tombs and palaces, also well worth visiting.</p>
<p>All these buildings and more are described and profusely illustrated in this guidebook, the first ever published for this region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Portuguese presence on the Arabian Sea coast of the Deccan dates from the beginning of the 16th century, with the establishment of Goa as the capital of a rapidly expanding maritime enterprise that eventually encompassed much of Asia. In order to protect the ships carrying their goods, merchants, troops and missionaries to India, the Portuguese constructed a string of seaside strongholds in and around Goa, and further up the coast of what is now Maharashtra.</p>
<p>This guidebook is the first to showcase the vestiges of the Portuguese sea forts of the Deccan, drawing attention to their surviving battlemented ramparts and angular bastions, watchtowers and lighthouses, chapels and churches. While some forts have recently been restored, such as Reis Magos and Tiracol in Goa, others are now dilapidated and overgrown.</p>
<p>This guidebook contains descriptions of all the major Portuguese sea forts of the region, illustrated with newly commissioned photographs and site maps.</p>

His images have been published in Discovering the Deccan: A Panoramic Journey Through Historical Landscapes &amp; Monuments (Mumbai, 2011), Temple Architecture and Art of the Early Chalukyas (New Delhi, 2014), and Hyderabad, Golconda (Mumbai, 2015).</p>
