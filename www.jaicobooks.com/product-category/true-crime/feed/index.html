										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three informers. Murky bylanes that hold the key to deadly terror plots. The chase for India’s most wanted terrorist. The lives of three of Mumbai Police’s best informers collide in this shady underworld.</p>
<p>It’s a bad, bad world. A world of crime, sex, drugs, murder and betrayal. He who lies, lives to see the light of another day&#8230; a day replete with even greater risks. From shady underworld dealings to switching gang loyalties, the men graduate to selling information on terrorism. Then begins the chase… to catch India’s most wanted terrorist: Riyaz Bhatkal, the man with an ominous track record of masterminding twenty-two blasts across the country since 2005.</p>
<p>The search takes them to the most unassuming yet dangerous terror hubs across India. With trust in short supply, time ticking away and the sword of Damocles over their heads, the men can only hope that they are not on a wild goose chase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the Shadow of Death is a retired CID chief’s quest to understand the psyche of death row prisoners. In this chilling account, D.V. Guruprasad delves deep into the world of crime to uncover who these convicts are and how they view the charges against them.</p>
<p>In India, capital punishment is awarded only in the ‘rarest of rare’ cases; the gruesome murders covered in this book will convince you that they fit the description.</p>
<p>Criminals featured in this book are as varied as they can come and so are their crimes: a serial killer who targeted young women, a savage gang that terrorized a metropolis, a runaway woman who took to murder as an easy way to survive, a constable with a deadly fetish …</p>
<p>As these prisoners stare death in the face,<br />
Do they experience the crippling “death row syndrome”?<br />
Do they fear the impending execution and the uncertainty about their final day on earth?<br />
Do they regret their past deeds?</p>
<p>There’s also the view from the other end of the rope—a peek into a hangman’s typical preparations before a hanging—making this a gripping read.</p>
