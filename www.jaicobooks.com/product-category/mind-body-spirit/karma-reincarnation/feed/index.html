										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Through numerous fascinating case histories, this book comprehensively explores the relationship between karma, disease and healing. This book will help you understand the Karmic law and its effect on your present life. And only by understanding karma will you be able to achieve your release from the worldly cycle.</p>
<p>The author has collected all previously known forms of karma, supplemented them with various new forms arising through experiences with regression therapy and catalogued them in 23 different types. The book first introduces you to karma and then draws you into the nuances of regression therapy. It is designed to help understand the law of karma and the ensuing insights to be gained from it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once you have read this book, you will no longer be the same person as you are now, at least as far as your outlook on life is concerned. Since the end of year 2000, reincarnation has finally been proven. The famous psychiatrist Professor Ian Stevenson M.D. has scientifically proven that reincarnation is a fact. A number of case histories substantiate this claim. Some of these have come from children and adults who remembered their past lives accurately. Others were retrieved by means of regression techniques.</p>
<p>The interest in reincarnation is growing every year. Today we no longer need to simply have faith, since reincarnation has been scientifically proven, just as the law of gravity was proven some time ago. We are now able to know that it is possible to return to this world repeatedly. What was until recently a belief for millions of people has now been discovered to be a truth.</p>
