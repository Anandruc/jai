										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This remarkable book uncovers the mystery of life in the spirit world after death on earth. Michael Newton, a hypnotherapist in private practice, has developed his own hypnosis technique to reach his subjects’ hidden memories of the hereafter. The resulting narrative acts as a progressive “travel log” of the accounts of 29 people who were placed in a state of superconsciousness. While in deep hypnosis, these subjects movingly describe what has happened to them between their former reincarnations on earth.</p>
<p>After reading Journey of Souls, you will learn specifics about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you see and feel right after death</li>
<li>Spiritual guides</li>
<li>What happens to “disturbed” souls</li>
<li>Why you are assigned to certain soul groups in the spirit world and what you do there</li>
<li>How you choose another body to return to earth</li>
<li>Different levels of souls: beginning, intermediate and advanced</li>
<li>When and where you first learn to recognize soulmates on earth</li>
<li>The purpose of life and manifestations of a “creator”</li>
</ul>
