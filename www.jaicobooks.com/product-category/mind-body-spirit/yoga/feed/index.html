										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PACKED WITH OVER eight hundred poses performed by renowned practitioner Yogrishi Vishvketu, this encyclopedia is the most comprehensive and authoritative yoga asana guide to date. With poses adapted to every skill level, this volume is an invaluable resource for both the yoga novice and the studio owner and is a crucial addition to any yoga lover’s library.</p>
<p>In addition to the tremendous number of postures pictured, thorough translation charts provide pose names in Sanskrit script, transliterated Sanskrit and English. These charts provide readers with a knowledge base they can take beyond these pages. The intuitive naming system created by Yogrishi Vishvketu helps practitioners gain an understanding of the relationship between the name and the spiritual significance of each pose, and the energetic essence of each asana is unveiled through a detailed chakra chart and chakra activation symbols.</p>
<p>Informed by the traditional Himalayan system and enhanced by Yogrishi Vishvketu’s decades of practice, Yogãsana: The Encyclopedia of Yoga Poses brings the many aspects of yoga – historical, cultural, spiritual and physical – into a single, all-inclusive volume.</p>
<p>Vishvaji is committed to offering holistic yoga workshops and yoga teacher trainings internationally and incorporating diverse aspects of yoga into his practice: asana, pranayama, cleansing kriyas, Ayurveda, and Vedic mantra. In 2000, he developed the holistic Akhanda Yoga® system, meaning ‘whole and indivisible,’ which he currently teaches in Canada and India. In 2007, he cofounded the Anand Prakash Yoga Ashram in Rishikesh, India, where he lives and teaches six months of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreword by <strong>Yogacharya Dr. Ananda Balayogi Bhavanani</strong>, Chairman,<br />
International Centre for Yoga Education and Research (ICYER)</p>
<p>In this gentle elaboration of the brilliant Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, Vasudev Murthy delves into life’s fundamental questions. Taking the reader through Patanjali’s 196 power-packed sutras, he explains the purpose and meaning of yoga, going beyond the popular physical aspects. He shares the steps we need to master to gain more control over our mind and, in turn, our daily life.</p>
<p>He effortlessly interprets Patanjali’s profound wisdom and deep insights, simplifying the complex Sanskrit sutras in layman’s terms and answering pressing questions that we have asked through our lifetimes: Who am I? Where have I come from, and where will I go?<br />
Why must I be born again and again?</p>
<p>In easy language, adding his own journey with the Yoga Sutras, the author distils the beautiful essence of this great cultural and spiritual masterpiece.</p>
