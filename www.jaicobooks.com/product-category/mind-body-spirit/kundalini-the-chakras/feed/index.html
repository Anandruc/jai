<p>This is a ground-breaking book about Kundalini and its connection with psychological vitality and spiritual transformation. Through author Darrel Irving’s own experience, Joseph Campbell’s documentation of Kundalini, and the case histories of Gopi Krishna and others, readers learn that kundalini is more than a spiritual concept, a religious illusion or a New Age fantasy. Kundalini is real.</p>
<p>It is a curative process if approached with knowledge and understanding, for Kundalini is healing – it is the mechanism of evolution contained in the human body.</p>
<p>Kundalini: The Serpent of Fire makes it abundantly clear that the experience of Kundalini is not just a special dispensation granted by fate or destiny to a select, privileged group. Nor is it the preserve of a few gurus or self-appointed holy men. Kundalini is for everyone, and Kundalini-activated individuals are the hope and promise of the new millennium.</p>

<p>As the energies of the Aquarian Age intensify, more and more people are experiencing spontaneous Kundalini releases that are incredibly powerful and sometimes startling. This book shows you how to release your Kundalini gradually and safely.</p>
<p>The section on Chakras brings new understanding to these “dials” on our life machine (body). It is the most comprehensive information available for cleansing and developing the Chakras and their energies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This universal force known has been shrouded in mystery for centuries, yet it influences our every breath, thought, and emotion. With Awakening Kundalini, one of the West’s most respected teachers and researchers in the field explores this spiritual principle in unprecedented depth, with detailed guidance for discovering and working with it directly.</p>
<p>With his unique expertise in modern psychology, neuroscience, meditation training, and spiritual traditions, Lawrence Edwards clarifies the many dimensions of Kundalini awakening, including practices and meditations for recognizing its manifestations and preparing your body and mind to enter its expansive, empowering flow.</p>
<p>When worked with skillfully, Kundalini is the most profoundly transformative power in our lives. Awakening Kundalini makes available a complete and practical resource for tapping into this force, and realizing your ability to live “radically free.”</p>
