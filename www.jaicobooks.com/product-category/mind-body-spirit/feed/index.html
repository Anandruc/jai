										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reformatted with new cover</p>
<p>This is a ground-breaking book about Kundalini and its connection with psychological vitality and spiritual transformation. Through author Darrel Irving’s own experience, Joseph Campbell’s documentation of Kundalini, and the case histories of Gopi Krishna and others, readers learn that kundalini is more than a spiritual concept, a religious illusion or a New Age fantasy. Kundalini is real.</p>
<p>It is a curative process if approached with knowledge and understanding, for Kundalini is healing – it is the mechanism of evolution contained in the human body.</p>
<p>Kundalini: The Serpent of Fire makes it abundantly clear that the experience of Kundalini is not just a special dispensation granted by fate or destiny to a select, privileged group. Nor is it the preserve of a few gurus or self-appointed holy men. Kundalini is for everyone, and Kundalini-activated individuals are the hope and promise of the new millennium.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This remarkable book uncovers the mystery of life in the spirit world after death on earth. Michael Newton, a hypnotherapist in private practice, has developed his own hypnosis technique to reach his subjects’ hidden memories of the hereafter. The resulting narrative acts as a progressive “travel log” of the accounts of 29 people who were placed in a state of superconsciousness. While in deep hypnosis, these subjects movingly describe what has happened to them between their former reincarnations on earth.</p>
<p>After reading Journey of Souls, you will learn specifics about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you see and feel right after death</li>
<li>Spiritual guides</li>
<li>What happens to “disturbed” souls</li>
<li>Why you are assigned to certain soul groups in the spirit world and what you do there</li>
<li>How you choose another body to return to earth</li>
<li>Different levels of souls: beginning, intermediate and advanced</li>
<li>When and where you first learn to recognize soulmates on earth</li>
<li>The purpose of life and manifestations of a “creator”</li>
</ul>
