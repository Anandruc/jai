										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to Achieve Every Goal You Set Using  •  Willpower, •  Self-Control, and  •  Mental Toughness</p>
<p>USE WILLPOWER TO ACHIEVE THE LIFE THAT YOU WANT.</p>
<p>Most people can&#8217;t accomplish what they want. They let themselves underachieve and don&#8217;t have the energy to do better. But you are different. You will learn the true meaning of mind over matter.</p>
<p>The Self-Discipline Manual is about training you (yes, training) to achieve everything that you want, and nothing less. It&#8217;s about understanding what causes motivation and self-discipline, and how to attack your daily tasks, habits, or goals with the fire of a thousand suns. We tackle this issue of you versus yourself from every possible angle so you become well-armed to face your lazy and procrastinating ways.</p>
<p>Inside, bestselling author Peter Hollins discusses:<br />
•  The biology of self-control and how to hack your body&#8217;s limitations<br />
•  Understanding all the roadblocks to motivation and self-control—almost all are psychological<br />
•  Why you must start managing your TIME, not your energy<br />
•  The role your neurotransmitters play in self-discipline<br />
•  How to make discomfort your best friend</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As one of the first female F-14 Tomcat fighter pilots in the US Navy, as well as a mom, wife, business consultant, Wall Street Journal bestselling author, and global speaker, Carey Lohrenz knows that the stress we experience can be just as intense as the stress in the cockpit of a fighter jet going Mach 2. But she’s got a secret weapon to prevail: years of training to overcome the specific natures of uncertainty, stress, burnout, anxiety, and pressure.</p>
<p>In Span of Control, Lohrenz walks us through the fundamentals of surviving and succeeding during times of crisis. To thrive when the pressure is on and to improve our performance overall, we’ve got to know what we can and cannot control.</p>
<p>Weaving together eye-opening science, gripping personal stories, insightful interviews, prescriptive advice, and a high-octane dose of encouragement and practicality, Span of Control helps leaders recognize how to focus on what matters most, formulate a plan for success, and communicate what’s possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each generation produces its “literature of power.” This type of writing literally has the power to change the reader’s life. In this tradition. In The Greatest Salesman In The World is destined to influence countless lives.</p>
<p>Here is the legend of Hafid, a camel boy of two thousand years ago, and his burning desire to improve his lowly position in life. To prove his potential ability, he is dispatched from Bethlehem by his master, the great caravan merchant, Pathros, to sell only one robe. He fails and instead, in a moment of pity, gives the robe to warm a newborn baby in a cave near the inn.</p>
<p>Hafid returns to the caravan in shame but is accompanied by a bright star shining above his head. This phenomenon is interpreted by Pathros to be a sign from the gods, and he gives Hafid ten ancient scrolls, which contain the wisdom necessary for the boy to achieve all his ambitions.</p>
