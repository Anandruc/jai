										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Practical, real-life methods to become the luckiest person you know, with no lucky charms or rituals needed to beat the odds.</p>
<p>Luck—we’re not sure what it is, but we know we want it on our side. Is luck a cosmic force that we can randomly stumble upon, or is there something real that people we consider lucky have discovered? The Science of Being Lucky is an in-depth look at what all lucky people have in common and how they set themselves up for success time after time.</p>
<p>Put success into your own hands, not fate’s.</p>
<p>The Science of Being Lucky takes you on a science-based journey into what luck is, what we think it is, and how to get more of it in your life. The journey begins by breaking down and defining the lucky breaks, coincidences, and serendipitous events in our lives—then delves into the specific traits, life factors, and perspectives that create lucky outcomes.</p>
<p>This book will open your eyes to what is behind each moment you would call lucky and give you a concrete action plan to create more of the same. Luck doesn’t have to be just fantasy. Here’s what’s inside to make you immune to bad luck:<br />
•  Popular methods for luck—do they work? (Some do, some do not)<br />
•  Avoiding bad luck internally and externally<br />
•  Three traits that practically manufacture luck<br />
•  Max Gunther’s famous “strategic luck planning” approach to life</p>

<p>USE WILLPOWER TO ACHIEVE THE LIFE THAT YOU WANT.</p>
<p>Most people can&#8217;t accomplish what they want. They let themselves underachieve and don&#8217;t have the energy to do better. But you are different. You will learn the true meaning of mind over matter.</p>
<p>The Self-Discipline Manual is about training you (yes, training) to achieve everything that you want, and nothing less. It&#8217;s about understanding what causes motivation and self-discipline, and how to attack your daily tasks, habits, or goals with the fire of a thousand suns. We tackle this issue of you versus yourself from every possible angle so you become well-armed to face your lazy and procrastinating ways.</p>
<p>Inside, bestselling author Peter Hollins discusses:<br />
•  The biology of self-control and how to hack your body&#8217;s limitations<br />
•  Understanding all the roadblocks to motivation and self-control—almost all are psychological<br />
•  Why you must start managing your TIME, not your energy<br />
•  The role your neurotransmitters play in self-discipline<br />
•  How to make discomfort your best friend</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not since the original publication of Think and Grow Rich in 1937 has there been a book that revolutionizes how an ordinary individual can manifest abundance, wealth and happiness in every aspect of life.</p>
<p>The Lost Secret provides a distillation of the key components of Think and Grow Rich and provides what Napoleon Hill and manifestation experts believe are the two Lost Chapters that were intended to be part of the 1937 edition.</p>
<p>These two chapters provide insights into the nature of vibrational manifestation in alignment with present-day quantum physics that would have seemed like unfounded speculation back in 1937. Although it’s impossible to prove through historical or scientific analyses that these two Lost Chapters were, in fact, written by Napoleon Hill, those most familiar with his writings and concepts are united in agreeing that these two chapters reflect Hill’s inimitable advice and wisdom, completing the gift that the original Think and Grow Rich was to the world. Together with the insights provided by author Monica Main—who has used these techniques to generate millions of dollars in wealth—you have in your hands one of the most extraordinary books ever published!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As one of the first female F-14 Tomcat fighter pilots in the US Navy, as well as a mom, wife, business consultant, Wall Street Journal bestselling author, and global speaker, Carey Lohrenz knows that the stress we experience can be just as intense as the stress in the cockpit of a fighter jet going Mach 2. But she’s got a secret weapon to prevail: years of training to overcome the specific natures of uncertainty, stress, burnout, anxiety, and pressure.</p>
<p>In Span of Control, Lohrenz walks us through the fundamentals of surviving and succeeding during times of crisis. To thrive when the pressure is on and to improve our performance overall, we’ve got to know what we can and cannot control.</p>
<p>Weaving together eye-opening science, gripping personal stories, insightful interviews, prescriptive advice, and a high-octane dose of encouragement and practicality, Span of Control helps leaders recognize how to focus on what matters most, formulate a plan for success, and communicate what’s possible.</p>
