										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A certain kind of busyness is crucial to life, allowing us to earn a living, create art, and achieve success. But too often it consumes us and we become very busy, expending extraneous effort that gets us nowhere. Marc Lesser’s new book shows us the benefits of doing less in a world that has increasingly embraced more—more desire, activity, things and exhaustion.</p>
<p>Less is about stopping, about the possibility of finding composure in the midst of activity. The ideas and practices that Lesser outlines offer a radical yet simple approach to transforming a lifestyle based on endless to-do lists into a meaningful approach that is more productive in every sense.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreword by Jack Canfield</p>
<blockquote><p>“Do whatever it is you want to do in life. Be whomever you want to be. Go wherever you want to go. Have whatever it is you want to have right now,” urges Pira.</p></blockquote>
<p>Inspired by his own massive life changes, Pira details his business journey from homeless and unemployed to telemarketer to a Thai baht billionaire. Using the principles developed by mentors including Brian Tracy, Jack Canfield, and Bob Proctor, Pira put their guidance into action. Innovating along the way and leveraging his own experiences with employees and clients; through failure and success, his 18 principles were forged. Uncanny wisdom from this millennial adventurer-turned-businessman is blended with proven research and case studies into powerful lessons.</p>
<p>The book is part autobiography, part success workbook, and 100% life lessons as Pira details how to move from fear to inspiration, competitiveness to domination, and student to mentor in business. His call to action is for readers to live their legacy every day.</p>
