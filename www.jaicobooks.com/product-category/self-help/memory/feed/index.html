										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Master The Mind Monkey gently guides you into deeper and deeper levels of understanding of the mind and the tricks it plays. It exposes the deepest truth in a manner that makes it very practical and applicable in one’s professional and personal life. The direct and lucid conversational style facilitates you to reach the “Ultimate Understanding”. The flow is pleasantly smooth, the words are endearingly down-to-earth and the sentences are refreshingly simple and shorn of clichés.</p>
<p>The book is full of lovely examples and humourous anecdotes that you can easily relate to. It is appreciative and empowering, yet at the same time, compassionately ruthless with falsehood, mental laziness, blame and a lack of commitment.</p>
<p>It is an impactful transformational experience that can serve as the bridge between the roots of Understanding and the fruits of tangible results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Edward de Bono believes in freedom, but he poses the question: “If you cannot see clearly, are you making a free choice?” That question is at the heart of his new book. De Bono has devoted his life and career to getting his readers—business leaders, educators, and politicians among others—to understand that clarity of thinking is essential to a free society. It is not enough to simply be free from coercion. De Bono argues that there is no true freedom without the ability to see correctly the options we have. And, to see these options requires thinking—thinking of a kind that De Bono says is not the norm and which urgently needs to be emphasized and taught.</p>
<p>The best short introduction to his work, The Free Mind uses anecdote to convey his ideas and provides numerous examples that illustrate his thesis: to be free means to understand the choices we make, and this understanding can only come through improving the way we think.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A certain kind of busyness is crucial to life, allowing us to earn a living, create art, and achieve success. But too often it consumes us and we become very busy, expending extraneous effort that gets us nowhere. Marc Lesser’s new book shows us the benefits of doing less in a world that has increasingly embraced more—more desire, activity, things and exhaustion.</p>
<p>Less is about stopping, about the possibility of finding composure in the midst of activity. The ideas and practices that Lesser outlines offer a radical yet simple approach to transforming a lifestyle based on endless to-do lists into a meaningful approach that is more productive in every sense.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreword by Jack Canfield</p>
<blockquote><p>“Do whatever it is you want to do in life. Be whomever you want to be. Go wherever you want to go. Have whatever it is you want to have right now,” urges Pira.</p></blockquote>
<p>Inspired by his own massive life changes, Pira details his business journey from homeless and unemployed to telemarketer to a Thai baht billionaire. Using the principles developed by mentors including Brian Tracy, Jack Canfield, and Bob Proctor, Pira put their guidance into action. Innovating along the way and leveraging his own experiences with employees and clients; through failure and success, his 18 principles were forged. Uncanny wisdom from this millennial adventurer-turned-businessman is blended with proven research and case studies into powerful lessons.</p>
<p>The book is part autobiography, part success workbook, and 100% life lessons as Pira details how to move from fear to inspiration, competitiveness to domination, and student to mentor in business. His call to action is for readers to live their legacy every day.</p>
