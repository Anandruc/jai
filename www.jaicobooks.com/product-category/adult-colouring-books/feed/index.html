										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This colouring book comprises more than 75 patterns, based on the study of neuroscience, to increase your focus through the use of pattern, repetition and creativity. It is inevitable that our brains get overwhelmed at times by the bombardment of information, but it is essential for our health and well being to be able to draw upon our own resources to deal with that stress.</p>
<p>The simple act of colouring has the power to engage your brain, improve your mood and kindle creativity by providing a mindful task. It can forge new neural pathways and connections in our brains. In this book, Dr. Stan Rodski looks at the fight-or-flight reaction to stress how colouring can stimulate the brain to be more agile and learn faster.</p>
<p>HAPPY COLOURING!</p>
