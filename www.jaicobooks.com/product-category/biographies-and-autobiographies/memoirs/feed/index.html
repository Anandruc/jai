										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Diary of a Young Girl is a simple and touching chronicling of a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl’s years in hiding from the Nazis during World War II.  Anne Frank, the diarist, was on the cusp of adolescence when her family had to flee Germany and take shelter in the Netherlands. The Franks were forced to live for two years confined in the attic before they were captured and sent to concentration camps.  </p>
<p>Anne manages to capture the horrors of being Jewish under the Nazi occupation through her recording of day-to-day life. Vivid, thoughtful and moving words describe the years of hunger, hardships and strained relationships between family members sharing limited space under the constant threat of discovery and subsequent arrest or death.</p>
<p>An important contribution to history, this honest account of life under tyranny resonates across time and around the world even today. Anne’s writing is a testimony to the human spirit’s ability to remain positive and hopeful amidst chaos and uncertainty.</p>
