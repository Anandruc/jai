										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Benjamin Franklin’s life was nothing short of astonishing. A polymath, he excelled in multiple fields, be it writing, publishing, politics, science, diplomacy or philosophy. One of the Founding Fathers, he is also known as the First American for his efforts in unifying the colonies to form today’s America.</p>
<p>In his autobiography, Franklin talks about his childhood, family, early career as a printing apprentice to his brother and his move from Boston to Philadelphia. His love for books shines through in his writing, and he shares practical advice for budding writers on improving their skills. Through his charming, original narration, he offers readers a close look at his life before the American Revolution. </p>
<p>Franklin’s life is the perfect example of achieving the famed American dream, but he didn’t consider himself to be perfect. His honest revelations and reflections on how he strived to be a better person through self-development make this autobiography a moving read. Franklin’s takes on how one<br />
can improve one’s own character, habits and performance are still relevant to all those determined to do their best in any given circumstance.</p>
