										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Benjamin Franklin’s life was nothing short of astonishing. A polymath, he excelled in multiple fields, be it writing, publishing, politics, science, diplomacy or philosophy. One of the Founding Fathers, he is also known as the First American for his efforts in unifying the colonies to form today’s America.</p>
<p>In his autobiography, Franklin talks about his childhood, family, early career as a printing apprentice to his brother and his move from Boston to Philadelphia. His love for books shines through in his writing, and he shares practical advice for budding writers on improving their skills. Through his charming, original narration, he offers readers a close look at his life before the American Revolution. </p>
<p>Franklin’s life is the perfect example of achieving the famed American dream, but he didn’t consider himself to be perfect. His honest revelations and reflections on how he strived to be a better person through self-development make this autobiography a moving read. Franklin’s takes on how one<br />
can improve one’s own character, habits and performance are still relevant to all those determined to do their best in any given circumstance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Diary of a Young Girl is a simple and touching chronicling of a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl’s years in hiding from the Nazis during World War II.  Anne Frank, the diarist, was on the cusp of adolescence when her family had to flee Germany and take shelter in the Netherlands. The Franks were forced to live for two years confined in the attic before they were captured and sent to concentration camps.  </p>
<p>Anne manages to capture the horrors of being Jewish under the Nazi occupation through her recording of day-to-day life. Vivid, thoughtful and moving words describe the years of hunger, hardships and strained relationships between family members sharing limited space under the constant threat of discovery and subsequent arrest or death.</p>
<p>An important contribution to history, this honest account of life under tyranny resonates across time and around the world even today. Anne’s writing is a testimony to the human spirit’s ability to remain positive and hopeful amidst chaos and uncertainty.</p>

<p>Mahatma Gandhi’s life was an experiment with truth. Put your principles to real practice—this was his message to the contemporary world.</p>
<p>To him God was Truth and Truth was God. Here are essays and reflections on Mahatma Gandhi, one of the outstanding personalities not only of our time but of all times.</p>
<p>Gandhiji was the greatest moral force in Indian history. For the accomplishment of liberty, justice, and peace, he rediscovered the old techniques of Ahimsa and Satyagraha. He revealed to the masses a power not of rifles and machine guns, but the power innate in each individual, a power which this war-haunted world can exploit fully in making wars impossible.</p>
<p>This book contains tribute to the Father of the Nation, from prominent thinkers like C.F. Andrews, Aldous Huxley, Lin Yutang, A.Coomaraswamy, Sri Aurobindo and many others. Some of Gandhiji’s most distinct and famous speeches are brought together in an appendix in this volume.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hugh Toye’s study of Subhash Chandra Bose is valuable on three counts: as a history of a little known facet of World War II, as a study in Anglo-Indian relations over a vital period, and as a study of the new kind of leaders in Asia. The story of Bose’s life is of absorbing interest, and the author makes him live in all his idealism, fiery nationalism, political astuteness and overriding arrogance. But more important are its implications, which must make the reader seriously rethink the role of European-Asian relations and, in rethinking, arrive at a better understanding of what is happening now and what may happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New edition</p>
<p>Gandhi’s face is instantly recognizable. But who was he? How did this young lawyer transform into the ‘great soul’ who led 400 million Indians in their nonviolent struggle for independence?</p>
<p>Easwaran, who grew up in Gandhi’s India, offers answers which are important both historically and personally. He gives a moving account of the turning points and choices in Gandhi’s life that made him not just a great political leader but also a timeless icon of nonviolence.</p>
<p>Gandhi’s inner transformation, the essence of this biography, contains an urgent message for us today. Non-violence, Easwaran explains, is a practical method for resolving problems, healing relationships, and raising the quality of our lives. It is a skill that is essential for the evolution, and perhaps even the survival, of our civilization.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jawaharlal Nehru has won the admiration of the people of India and the world as a national leader, as a writer, as a humanist etc. Anyone who wishes to understand the controversial aspects of his personality would do well to peruse this biography. This work also traces the history of the freedom movement in India.</p>
<p>The occasional glimpses of the family life of Nehru are enlivening. He was the most remarkable statesman, a man who enthralled everyone with his magical personality; a leader who was literally hero-worshipped and an orator of the order, who, once he climbed the rostrum and took the microphone in his hand, became one with the audience and held them spellbound. The colourful and complex personality of Nehru is viewed through Indian eyes—a fact which makes the book all the more interesting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My Experiments With Truth – the autobiography of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (or Mahatma Gandhi) covers his life from early childhood through to 1920, and is a popular and influential book. It was initiated at the insistence of Swami Anand and other close co-workers of Gandhi, in his mother-tongue Gujarati entitled Satyana Prayogo athva Atmakatha.</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948) was a charismatic leader who brought the case for India’s independence to world attention. His philosophy of nonviolence, for which he coined the term satyagraha, has influenced nonviolent resistance movements to this day. For Gandhi, Truth was the sovereign principle; inclusive of many other spiritual principles and schools of thought.</p>
<p>In this autobiography, Gandhi has recounted the period from his birth (1869) up to the year 1921. In the last chapter, he notes, “My life from this point onward has been so public that there is hardly anything about it that people do not know&#8230;”</p>
