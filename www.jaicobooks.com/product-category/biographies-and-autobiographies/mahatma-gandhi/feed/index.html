										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New edition</p>
<p>Gandhi’s face is instantly recognizable. But who was he? How did this young lawyer transform into the ‘great soul’ who led 400 million Indians in their nonviolent struggle for independence?</p>
<p>Easwaran, who grew up in Gandhi’s India, offers answers which are important both historically and personally. He gives a moving account of the turning points and choices in Gandhi’s life that made him not just a great political leader but also a timeless icon of nonviolence.</p>
<p>Gandhi’s inner transformation, the essence of this biography, contains an urgent message for us today. Non-violence, Easwaran explains, is a practical method for resolving problems, healing relationships, and raising the quality of our lives. It is a skill that is essential for the evolution, and perhaps even the survival, of our civilization.</p>

Yet from the ruthless Pathan tradition in Indian’s rugged North-West Frontier Province, Khan raised history’s first nonviolent “army” of 100,00 men.</p>
<p>Many cautioned Gandhi against involving in his nonviolent struggle these people with such a record of brutality. But under Khan’s leadership the Pathans proved that it is often those who are capable of great violence who have the courage to stand unarmed against injustice.</p>
