										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today’s fractured Indian society that has no answers for them, a bright architecture student Shezii questions his existence while Aliya, a celebrity daughter, struggles to find her anchor. To add to their woes, an international terror organization is planning to disrupt their already turbulent lives and question their loyalty to their homeland.</p>
<p>Caught between the crossfire of religious isolation and fanaticism, Shezii and Aliya decide to fight out their own battles. But the repercussions of their decisions will unwittingly plunge Shezii, Aliya and all those around them into the vortex of intense love, burning hatred and vile treachery. As they finally reach an inevitable crossroad in life, they must choose where they belong.</p>
<p>Will their distant past come back to haunt them? Will it put their families, even their country, at a grave risk? And, are they willing to pay the ultimate price in blood?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Research shows that CSR improves long-term business performance and that consumers prefer to patronise organisations with strong histories of social responsibility. Today’s customers and employees are speaking with their values as well as their wallets! Consumers are sensitive to empty promises and want brands to be committed to the planet, sustainability and other social issues.</p>
<p>This book argues that trust is at stake for every organisation and is the reason why communications strategies must respond authentically. If you can’t be authentic about social initiatives, then don&#8217;t do it because CSR is not a publicity tool! Yet some see the relationship as nothing but a marketing trick—an organisation&#8217;s blatant self-promotion.</p>
<p>Inside these pages you will find invaluable insights from established companies like Tata, Dabur, and ITC, alongside interviews with global business leaders and emerging social entrepreneurs responding to this shifting perspective of CSR worldwide and in India. This book will define the real role of PR in CSR and what that relationship should be.</p>
