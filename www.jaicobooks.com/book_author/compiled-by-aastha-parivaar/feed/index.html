										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sex work—the world’s oldest profession. A world of shadows and sleaze. Of faceless, nameless individuals. Walking and talking bodies dolled up in glittering clothes and deceiving make-up, flashing frozen smiles, willing to sell themselves for a square meal. But carrying within them tarnished souls and fractured dignities.</p>
<p>Not Like Most Young Girls is a collection of short stories written by young minds from eminent educational institutions from Mumbai, presenting before society the human beings hidden within the sex workers. These are stories of women, men and hijras who have come together under Aastha Parivaar. Not Like Most Young Girls is more than a book—it is an attempt to bring out of the shadows, these individuals who breathe, feel, and give back to society, just as any one of us do—or perhaps more.</p>
