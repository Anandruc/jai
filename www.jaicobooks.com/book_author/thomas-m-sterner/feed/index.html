										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Developing focus &amp; discipline in your life</p>
<p>In The Practicing Mind, Thomas Sterner demonstrates how to acquire skills for any aspect of life, be it business, parenting or sports. It has always been about trial and error, and practice. If we had given up in the face of failure, repetition and difficulty, we would never have learned to walk or tie our shoes. So why, as adults, do we give up on a goal when we don’t succeed at first?</p>
<p>Sterner has an answer to this: we have forgotten the principles of practice – the process of picking a goal and applying steady effort to reach it. The methods Sterner teaches show that proper practice isn’t drudgery on the way to mastery, but in fact, a fulfilling process in and of itself, one that builds discipline and clarity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To be fully engaged requires clear goals, and the focus and skill set to accomplish them with calm awareness. In his first book, The Practicing Mind, Tom Sterner provided clear guidelines for developing focus and discipline to achieve any life goal. As he travelled and spoke about it, he kept track of the questions that readers and participants at his seminars asked. Addressing and exploring these questions, Sterner provides specific techniques such as thought awareness training, and setting goals with accurate data. He shows how these methods can be used to meet objectives while keeping you engaged every moment in your life when pursuing these goals. This reduces stress, consequently increasing the quality of life.</p>
