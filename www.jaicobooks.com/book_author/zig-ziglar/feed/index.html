<p>The Art of Selling describes the basics of how you can persuade people more effectively, more ethically, and more often. You’ll also discover that there is virtually nothing on earth that brings as much personal satisfaction as being able to save another person time, money, or frustration because of the goods, products, and services you have to offer.</p>
<p>Bestselling motivational author Zig Ziglar draws from his selling experiences to show you how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work smarter, not harder in your sales career</li>
<li>Move beyond customer service to customer satisfaction</li>
<li>Sell by design, not chance</li>
<li>Gain control of your time and life</li>
<li>Polish your skills as a professional persuader</li>
</ul>
<p>The Art of Selling shows you the basics of how to build a more successful sales career before, during, and after the sale is made. With these skills, you build a solid business, a more satisfying life, and a professional selling career that makes a positive difference in today’s world.</p>
