										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throbbing with non-stop excitement, Shiva in the City of Nectar sweeps across Heaven, Earth and the Underworld, narrating the exploits of the mysterious and powerful blue-throated god.</p>
<p>One after another, the tales unfold the follies of ancient devas, asuras, sages, men and mythical beasts. And through them all, Shiva blithely takes on the guise of beggar, saint, monarch, merchant, fisherman, hunter, warrior and woodcutter; walking through the three worlds to slay rampaging demons, perform his Dance of Bliss and embrace good and bad alike.</p>
<p>Shiva is portrayed in all his multi-faceted mystique – the tender lover who woos and weds Goddess Meenakshi; the eternal Guru who dispenses wisdom; the fierce avenger whose third eye flashes fire; the generous benefactor who showers blessings on his devotees; and, above all, the gentle prankster who embodies the essence of Vedic faith.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The asura king snarled and launched an avalanche of arrows at his adversary. Kartikeya countered with his mystic spear, which emitted a flurry of sparks, incinerating the oncoming missiles with consummate ease. The champion of the gods then whirled his discus. The twirling orb of light danced lethally through the asura army, obliterating Surapadma’s hordes. Weaponless, armour shattered and flagstaff severed, Surapadma stood defenseless on the field.</p>
<p>Son of Shiva is the gripping narrative of the warrior-god Kartikeya, commander-in-chief of the heavenly hosts, and epitome of wisdom and valour. The book depicts in mesmerizing prose the monumental battle between the forces of good and evil, as embodied by the devas and asuras.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As its mahout goaded the mammoth royal elephant to the open space where Navukkarasu was held, the beast trumpeted in fury, knocking down walls and ornamental arches in wanton aggression. The earth shook under its tread and the crowd surged back in fear.</p>
<p>Navukkarasu fearlessly stood his ground asserting, “The Cosmic Dancer who wears a garment of elephant hide will protect me.”</p>
<p>The animal charged forward &#8211; only to stop short before the saint. In an instant, all aggression leached out of the beast. As docile as a lamb, the elephant circumambulated Navukkarasu, clumsily fell to its knees, and raised its trunk in homage to him. Lumbering to its feet, it then carefully backed away from its intended victim.</p>
<p>Hounds of Shiva is a treasure house of tales with impassioned, heroic acts of sacrifice, devotion and service in the lives and times of the Nayanmars – the sixty-three Shaivite saints who were exemplars of bhakti. Kannappa gouges out his eye to heal Shiva’s wound; Punitavati renounces her youth and beauty to follow the Lord as an emaciated ghoul; Siruthondar sacrifices his own son at Shiva’s command; Iyarpahai gifts his beloved wife to another man; Samandhar raises a boy from the dead; Poosal builds an intricate Shiva temple in his heart.</p>
<p>But the book’s hero is Lord Shiva, who assumes myriad disguises to sport with his devotees, blessing and testing them. Filled with astounding miracles, Hounds of Shiva is an untold tale of the Blue-throated Lord and a feast for the mind and soul.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Suddenly, the silence of the jungle was shattered by the crash of branches. The prince froze. Some large animal threshed through the thick undergrowth. Manikanthan silently followed the trail of destruction. He emerged from the jungle onto the banks of the Azhutha.</p>
<p>There before him stood a huge she-buffalo, muscles rippling as she lapped the water. It was none other than the wicked Mahishi.</p>
<p>Sensing the intruder in her domain, Mahishi raised her head. A young boy stood by the forest edge. He held a bow in his hand; a sword hung in the scabbard by his side.</p>
<p>The asura and the boy stood motionless, locking eyes.</p>
<p>The Warrior God: Ayyappa of Sabarimalai depicts the epic confrontation between good and evil. Mahishi, the buffalo-headed asura princess, wreaks vengeance on the devas for killing her brother, the mighty Mahishasura. She subjugates the gods and unleashes a reign of terror on the three worlds.</p>
<p>A series of divine events culminate in the birth of Mahishi’s nemesis, Hariharaputra – the son of Shiva and Vishnu, later known as Ayyappa. The baby, raised on earth as a prince of the Pandalam dynasty, awaits his tryst with destiny.</p>
<p>Here is the story of Sabarimalai, where legend and history meld into one tidal wave of devotion. Discover why five crore pilgrims annually ford rivers and trek through forests and hills to pay homage to Ayyappa.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dance of Shiva &amp; Other Divine Tales explores the mysteries that lie behind some of our most ancient and revered temples—from Kanyakumari to Kanchipuram. Revealing the legends behind the origins of these temples and the wonders associated with them, these stories will delight anyone fascinated by Indian folklore.</p>
<p>These timeless and enchanting stories narrate the triumph of good over evil; they portray god’s compassion towards man; they reveal the miracles worked by devotion. Immensely engaging and magical, the action in these narratives ranges over heaven and earth: Indra is punished for lusting after a sage’s wife; Narada uses his tricks to stop Shiva’s marriage to Parvati; Kannagi’s curse reduces Madurai to ashes; Vishnu saves Gajendran, the elephant, from the crocodile’s clutches … and much more. A collection that is in equal parts enlightening and enthralling.</p>
