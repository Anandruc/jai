										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shijukutty, a Malayali fisherman, leaves his tiny hamlet of abject poverty in a coastal village in search of his destiny in Dubai, that gleaming hub of fortune, like millions of his brethren. What unfolds is a stirring saga of hardship, exploitation, identity, and friendship, and the heartbreaking choices Shiju is often forced to make.</p>
<p>What he sees is not what he experiences when he lands in a world of glimmering towers, fast-paced life, and unabashed opulence. Shiju’s life takes dramatic turns in the Dream City’s dark underbelly. But he holds his ground, drawing on the ancient instincts of his seafaring ancestry. To make matters worse, he is inexorably pulled into the canyon of global recession…</p>
<p>Will Shiju be able to hold on to his dreams? Will he survive against all odds? Will he redeem himself?</p>
<p>Nikhil Ramteke weaves a captivating tale of migrant labourers, their struggles, their loneliness, and their dreams.</p>
