										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>VUCA in Start-Ups attempts to capture a start-up’s entrepreneurial journey and find out why some do well when others don’t.</p>
<p>It’s a highly volatile environment out there for entrepreneurs and start-ups, thanks to the unprecedented Covid-19 crisis filled with volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA). Many businesses that did well in the past had to shut shop as a result. So what went wrong?</p>
<p>To find the answer, it’s important to understand what worked in the past and why a new venture must discover fresh and innovative opportunities to survive.</p>
<p>Learn from those who chose the road less travelled, including Zomato, Paytm, Flipkart, Ola Cabs and Quikr, and discover the underlying causes for start-up successes and failures.</p>
<p>These well-researched case studies aim to inspire those who wish to embark on an entrepreneurial journey.</p>
