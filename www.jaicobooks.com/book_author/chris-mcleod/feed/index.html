										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine’s most popular comedic actor was an unlikely president of his country. And now, even more improbably, Volodymyr Zelensky has become the world’s most celebrated statesman. Who is he? How did he become the international hero of our time?</p>
<p>Zelensky: The Unlikely Ukrainian Hero Who Defied Putin and United the World is a compelling account of this fascinating, enigmatic leader. Covering Zelensky’s childhood, family history, and astonishing transformation from TV celebrity to first Jewish president of Ukraine, this book tells you what you need to know about the newest star of the world stage.</p>
<p>No one has been more surprised by Zelensky’s power to inspire and mobilize his countrymen and the world than Vladimir Putin, who expected Russia’s conquest of its beleaguered neighbor to be the work of an afternoon. Outfoxed and isolated, Putin is not the first person to have underestimated the former comedian with a spine of steel.</p>
<p>Foreword by Rebekah Koffler, US intelligence expert &amp; author</p>
