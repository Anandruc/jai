										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thou Shalt Innovate profiles wondrous Israeli innovations that are collectively changing the lives of billions of people around the world and explores why Israeli innovators of all faiths feel compelled to make the world better. Israel is playing a disproportionate role in helping solve some of the world’s biggest challenges by tapping into the nation’s soul: the spirit of tikkun olam – the Jewish concept of repairing the world.</p>

A must read for business leaders, newbie start-up owners and anyone who is interested in how innovations are conceived and carried out.</p>
