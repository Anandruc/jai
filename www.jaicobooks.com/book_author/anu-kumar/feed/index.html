										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The brilliant star-reader Varahamihira, one of the famed Nine Gems of the king’s court, predicts a rare eclipse that has alarming consequences. Soon after, the scrolls carrying his predictions go missing. While the court considers how to retrieve them, they receive news of yet another disappearance ? none other than their celebrated poet Kalidasa! The kingdom erupts in an uproar.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in our own time, an adventure begins for Atisa, the teenage owner of a time-travelling flying machine! On a peaceful night in the snow-capped Himalayas, Atisa hears mysterious wails of distress through his state-of-the-art sound-catcher. In a whirlwind of events, he is transported to the midst of ancient Pataliputra and its imbroglio over the missing scrolls and poet.</p>
<p>Will Atisa save Kalidasa and the scrolls?</p>
