										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When will my baby first smile? How much of my two-year-old’s speech should I be able to understand? When will my child know how to ‘play nicely’? Or tie shoelaces? Or catch a ball?</p>
<p>Young children develop at a dizzying rate, constantly reaching new milestones. Of course, each child is different but many parents will want to know if their baby or toddler is developing as expected. Written by a practising GP, The First 5 Years provides clear guidelines for what to expect during each stage of this precious time in your child’s life.</p>
<p>It shows how children learn through play and provides practical, imaginative tips on dealing with the challenges they can bring.</p>
<p>Discover how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deal with the difficulties of tantrums, toilet training and fussy eating</li>
<li>Turn everyday situations, such as tidying up or going to the park, into fun, learning events</li>
<li>Use playdough to develop manual dexterity</li>
<li>Help your child on their first day at school or nursery</li>
</ul>
<p>Practical and reassuring, The First 5 Years will be a constant companion as your child grows up.</p>
