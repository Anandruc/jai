										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As told to Suman Chhabria Addepalli</p>
<p>With a foreword by Rashmi Bansal Bestselling author</p>
<p>Indra Nooyi said, “Women can’t have it all!”<br />
It’s either career or family.<br />
I disagree.</p>
<p>As I see it, we can have it all – a successful company, a loving family and the opportunity to follow our passion.</p>
<p>When I was a teenager, I started a small ghar-ka-business selling trendy handbags. Today, Baggit is a 100-crore company.</p>
<p>Along the way, I became a wife and a mom, and navigated the various twists and turns in my personal life. I could do it all because of my loving, supportive family and my guru, who have made me a better person and a better entrepreneur.</p>
<p>This is the story of how a C-minus student – a failure in college – became an A-plus entrepreneur.</p>
<p>If I can do it, so can you. My secrets are in these pages.</p>
