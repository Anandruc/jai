										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It all started when an Italian scholar travelled from Venice to 221B Baker Street, to beg the help of the legendary detective. He carried an ancient parchment, written in the hand of Marco Polo himself. It was torn in half, centuries ago, to protect the world from a terrifying secret, one that apparently Marco Polo and the Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta, took dramatic steps to guard. Holmes sprang into action. He faked his death at Reichenbach and proceeded undercover to Venice.</p>
<p>From 1891 to 1894, when Sherlock Holmes was dead to the world, he was having the grandest adventures of his career. From the Vatican to Morocco, and from the Sahara to the ancient city of Timbuktu, Holmes and Watson were on a dauntless journey, one where the duo confronted ruthless criminals, an ancient culture and a staggering surprise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreword by <strong>Yogacharya Dr. Ananda Balayogi Bhavanani</strong>, Chairman,<br />
International Centre for Yoga Education and Research (ICYER)</p>
<p>In this gentle elaboration of the brilliant Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, Vasudev Murthy delves into life’s fundamental questions. Taking the reader through Patanjali’s 196 power-packed sutras, he explains the purpose and meaning of yoga, going beyond the popular physical aspects. He shares the steps we need to master to gain more control over our mind and, in turn, our daily life.</p>
<p>He effortlessly interprets Patanjali’s profound wisdom and deep insights, simplifying the complex Sanskrit sutras in layman’s terms and answering pressing questions that we have asked through our lifetimes: Who am I? Where have I come from, and where will I go?<br />
Why must I be born again and again?</p>
<p>In easy language, adding his own journey with the Yoga Sutras, the author distils the beautiful essence of this great cultural and spiritual masterpiece.</p>
