										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The news keeps getting worse: the economy, climate change, global conflict. Not a day goes by that we’re not faced with another grim prediction; another indication that the way we live our lives is undergoing a fundamental change. And while change can indeed be good, it can also be stressful and worrisome.</p>
<p>In Staying Afloat When the Water Gets Rough, Dr. Posen asks, “What can be done to increase our comfort with the daily changes in our outside environment?” With compassion, understanding and humour, he explains the ingredients for “change-hardiness,” illustrating his message with stories from his own experience as well as from that of his patients and friends.</p>
<p>Part psychology, part philosophy, part action plan, the book will make you think, it will make you laugh and it will definitely increase your comfort with the changes happening around you.</p>
