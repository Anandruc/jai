										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Story of Disney is about two brothers and their animated dreams that went on to become a billion-dollar enterprise. From movies to theme parks, the Disney brothers – Walt and Roy – always tried to give their audience something new; something memorable; something big. Walt in particular was a man of innovation and is credited with many firsts in the motion picture industry – first-ever cartoon with sound, first colour cartoon, the animated feature film… to list but a few.</p>
<p>Originally a film studio, the Walt Disney company is now involved in nearly every aspect of the entertainment world. This book is a roller-coaster ride through the legacy of the creator of many a dear cartoon and animated character of our times.</p>
<p>Jaico’s creative Companies series explores how today’s great companies operate and inspires young readers to become the entrepreneurs and businessmen of tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nicknamed Coke, a company that churns out a revenue of USD 24 billion a year had a rather humble beginning. When local pharmacist John Pemberton brewed a mix of fruit syrup, extracts from cola nut, cocoa leaf and several other ingredients to create a tonic, little did he know he was creating a brand which would later become synonymous with having a good time – frothing with fun and frolic.</p>
<p>The Story of Coca-Cola is the chronicler of a journey that started in 1886 at the back of a shop in Atlanta, Georgia, to become the global leader in the beverage industry; through their shares of wars, scandals, ups and downs. It is the story of a survivor, a world leader.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, opinions about South Africa’s first democratically elected president remain split. But no matter how they feel about Mandela, most South Africans acknowledge that they owe him for many of the freedoms they enjoy.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Mandela became a symbol of what it meant to stand up to oppression and then to forgive the oppressor. The South African freedom fighter was jailed for 26 years, from the age of 46 to 71, for his protests against apartheid.</p>
<p>From militant resistance against a white government to call for reconciliation, from challenging his oppressors to later famously forgiving them, from spending decades in prison to acknowledging those years as a period of learning, Mandela’s views and his politics are not palatable to all, but they certainly made heads turn and garnered him and his fight global recognition. Read all about the controversial life of Nelson Mandela, the man who was born to be king.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He faced segregation and racism in early childhood. Inspired by the teachings of Jesus Christ and the ideologies of Mahatma Gandhi, King formed his own philosophies regarding a nonviolent lifestyle. Even when faced with insults, beatings and jail time, he remained resolute in his efforts to eradicate injustice, poverty and war. His critics felt he was destroying peace in their community through protests and marches. The nonviolent movement also drew ire from sections of society which believed violence was a necessary form of self-defense.</p>
<p>Even today, his powerful speeches inspire people to fight for equality and justice as can be seen in the Black Lives Matter Movement that is reverberating through the United States.</p>
