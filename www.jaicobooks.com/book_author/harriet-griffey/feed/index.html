										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having confidence helps in all aspects of life, from interviewing for a job and making presentations, to attending parties and going on dates. It may seem as if some people are just born feeling capable and secure, but in I want to Be Confident Harriet Griffey shows that these are skills anyone can learn.</p>
<p>Confidence is about having an internalised belief in yourself that is built on successful past experiences, many of which we can create for ourselves. Find out what you are good at and build on that. Stamp out that inner critic. Small steps, big change—and a more confident you.</p>
<p>Full of practical tips, ideas and inspiration, I want to Be Confident gives you the skills and tools that will help build your confidence from day one.</p>
