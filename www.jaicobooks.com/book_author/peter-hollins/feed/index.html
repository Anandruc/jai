										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to Achieve Every Goal You Set Using  •  Willpower, •  Self-Control, and  •  Mental Toughness</p>
<p>USE WILLPOWER TO ACHIEVE THE LIFE THAT YOU WANT.</p>
<p>Most people can&#8217;t accomplish what they want. They let themselves underachieve and don&#8217;t have the energy to do better. But you are different. You will learn the true meaning of mind over matter.</p>
<p>The Self-Discipline Manual is about training you (yes, training) to achieve everything that you want, and nothing less. It&#8217;s about understanding what causes motivation and self-discipline, and how to attack your daily tasks, habits, or goals with the fire of a thousand suns. We tackle this issue of you versus yourself from every possible angle so you become well-armed to face your lazy and procrastinating ways.</p>
<p>Inside, bestselling author Peter Hollins discusses:<br />
•  The biology of self-control and how to hack your body&#8217;s limitations<br />
•  Understanding all the roadblocks to motivation and self-control—almost all are psychological<br />
•  Why you must start managing your TIME, not your energy<br />
•  The role your neurotransmitters play in self-discipline<br />
•  How to make discomfort your best friend</p>
