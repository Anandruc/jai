										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Invest in Your Attitude is a roadmap to a more resilient attitude that will help you successfully navigate sudden change, overcome surprise difficulties, and generate positive outcomes. You will learn how to invest in your most important asset—your attitude!</p>
<p>Following the suggestions in this book will lead to an overflow­ing sense of hope, confidence, and resilience. They will also help you to improve your self-regard, create healthier relationships, increase your productivity, and get more satisfaction out of life.</p>
<p>Don’t mistake this book for just another “positive thinking” guide. There are plenty of those, and many of them have merit. This book is intended for people who are tired of saying they want to improve their lives and are finally ready to do whatever it takes to enhance their health and relationships, their finances, and their careers. If you fall into this category, then this book is for you.</p>
