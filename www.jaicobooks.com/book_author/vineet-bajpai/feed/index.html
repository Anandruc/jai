										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The career landscape has changed. It is no more the wear-a-tie, carry-your-lunchbox, meet-your-deadline world. It is now an all-enticing gold-rush. The winners become modern-day emperors, and the mediocre walk like lifeless robots… in the millions. It is a veritable war-zone. And like every fortune-hunt in history – it is the survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it is simply natural-selection catching-up. It is the emergence of the indomitable 30-something champions who are changing the game in every field! These unbeatable super-achievers are still in their thirties or early forties – and they stop at nothing. These are punishing trailblazers who change the rules of the whole goddamned sport!</p>
<p>Are you one of them? Will you make it to the league of these magnificent young winners? The 30-Something CEO will crack the code for you, and partner you in your accelerated journey towards spectacular success. But be cautioned – it is going to be one helluva ride!</p>
