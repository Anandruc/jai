										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Worlds in Harmony, the Dalai Lama explores the nature of suffering and its release through compassionate action. It focuses on the understanding that a deep awareness of our shared desire to avoid pain leads to an awareness of our responsibility to relieve others of suffering.</p>
<p>Worlds in Harmony offers the reader insight into the relation between awareness and right action, and bridges personal consciousness and global concerns. With the knowledge that insight is of no use unless it results in action, the Dalai Lama teaches ways of being, thinking, and acting in the world that are based on equanimity and understanding. This book can be a key guide to the practice of healing and compassionate action in daily life.</p>
