										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What if creating deeper, meaningful relationships is easier that you think it is?</p>
<p>We want people in our lives we can trust, confide in and turn to when life gets tough – people who not only appreciate our gifts but who are also fully aware of our flaws and failures, yet want to be with us anyway.</p>
<p>The good news is that forming fulfilling bonds with your spouse, friends, kids and coworkers is not only attainable, it is what you were made for!</p>
<p>In The Power of Relationships, bestselling author John Ortberg shows us how to overcome obstacles and create the kind of tender, affectionate relationships we all crave. You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to recognize and respond to bids for connection</li>
<li>How to get past the fear of intimacy</li>
<li>How to sidestep common relationship pitfalls</li>
<li>How to deal with rejection</li>
</ul>
<p>Nurturing relationships of course take time, but it’s definitely worth it!</p>
