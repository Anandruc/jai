										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The path to better problem solving, accurate decision making and self-disciplined thinking Einstein, Plato and Sherlock—these great names have something in common, they are all exceptional critical thinkers. What did they do differently that made them so recognizable for their intellects?</p>
<ul>
<li>They thought slowly and deliberately before making a snap judgment or decision</li>
<li>They questioned every fact and opinion, including their own</li>
<li>They took the time to study the subject of their decision- making to gather information before jumping to conclusions</li>
<li> They accepted and expected that human nature is ultimately biased and prone to make cognitive errors</li>
</ul>
<p>The Critical Thinker gives you a thorough description of the rules and principles of critical thinking practiced by every great thinker in history to help you make better decisions in specific situations. These critical thinking principles will help your personal life, career, and friendships.</p>
