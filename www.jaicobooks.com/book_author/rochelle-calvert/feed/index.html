										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to psychologist and mindfulness expert Rochelle Calvert, one of the greatest sources of healing from trauma is all around us—nature.</p>
<p>In this powerful book, Calvert explores how to relate to and connect with nature through mindfulness. She integrates many nature-based principles and somatic practices, applying them in innovative ways to address pain, showing in particular how to ground oneself.</p>
<p>She shows how it’s possible to relax the nervous system and tune in to the somatic wisdom of the body, to face lingering grief and rewire it.</p>
<p>As a nature meditation teacher, the author offers reflections and activities that connect with a person’s true self, all while using nature as a grounding and connecting restorative force.</p>
<p>With the help of this book, you’ll be able to work with painful experiences to transform them in ways that heal you and contribute<br />
to healing the wider world.</p>
<p>Healing with Nature pioneers a path not just to recovery but to lifelong healing and resilience.</p>
