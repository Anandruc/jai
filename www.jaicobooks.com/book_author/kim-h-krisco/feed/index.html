										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The saga begins with The Bonnie Bag of Bones, which leads the famous duo on a chase into the legendary mountains of Scotland.</p>
<p>In Curse of the Black Feather, Holmes teams up with the Irregulars and a gypsy matriarch to expose a diabolical “baby-farming” enterprise. Their adventure continues through Maestro of Mysteries – with a deadly hunt under the streets of London – and The Cure that Kills – with a race across America and against the largest detective organization in the world.</p>
<p>In the final story, The Kongo Nkis Spirit Train, Holmes and Watson travel to the Dark Continent to derail a “spirit train” that ensnares people’s spirits and enslaves their bodies.</p>
