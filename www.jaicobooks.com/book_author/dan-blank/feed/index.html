										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Football is a game of split-second decisions. Every move of every player in a team has to be precise and synchronized to win within 90 minutes. Football Tips is all about those little decisions that can change the outcome of a game.</p>
<p>Standing on two decades of collegiate coaching experience, Dan Blank has catalogued football’s most common mistakes and provides simple, connect-the-dots solutions to help players solve their problems.</p>
<p>Blank covers everything from hunting rebounds to the value of the toe-ball; from playing in the rain to the world’s dumbest foul. Written in plain-spoken language, this book is an easy read and a quick-fix to the most common yet critically important football hitches. A must-read for any aspiring player, coach or parent who wants to understand the game better.</p>
