										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you are a senior leader or aspire to be one, at some point you’ll face a paradoxical risk. As you pile up successes, your job will get bigger than you, and you may become disoriented by a world of unfamiliar challenges.</p>
<p>What Happens Now? will help you learn how to conquer the new challenges of sophistication – rather than just navigating the greater complexity – by doing things you’ve never done before. You will succeed by achieving these goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadcasting a vision with clarity and purpose</li>
<li>Aligning a high-performing team</li>
<li>Communicating and leading change</li>
<li>Focusing your time and energy in the right places</li>
<li>Investing in coaching and creating other leaders</li>
</ul>
<p>As experienced troubleshooters for hundreds of executives and organizations, John Hillen and Mark Nevins will show you how to foresee the stalls that threaten every leader – and overcome them.</p>
