										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lord Krishna is at once historical and mythological. He is the awesome architect of His age and the illuminating mentor whose discourse, the Bhagavad Gita, is regarded as a light unto all ages. The book Krishna: A Journey through the Lands &amp; Legends of Krishna describes well known tourist places and narrates the famous legends associated with them. It also presents places that may not be known to a common man but have witnessed the glorious pastimes of Lord Krishna and associated legends. It is an innovative book that has a happy blending of a travelogue with mythological reminiscences.</p>
<p>The centres visited are placed in a setting which gives them a tinge of human emotions; brick and marble speak to the visitor and tell stories. The past and the present mingle, and the visit becomes a memorable experience.</p>
