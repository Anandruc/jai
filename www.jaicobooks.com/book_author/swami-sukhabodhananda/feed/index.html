										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Gita teaches us the art of being total. Use your actions in an attitude of karma yoga, use your feelings in devotion in bhakti yoga, use your intellect for right understanding in jnana yoga and use your being in silence in dhyana yoga.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad Gita helps us to tune to our inner pure state and denounce the illusion of security. Clarity, courage and wisdom are true security. Bhagavad Gita helps us to learn to draw energy from our inner state and achieve personal excellence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ability is an important tool in life. Ability without commitment and awareness is like a vehicle without the engine.</p>
<p>The Shiva Sutra enhances one’s awareness in a way one sees an opportunity in a difficulty and not a difficulty in an opportunity. There is an ‘outside reality’ and an ‘inside reality’ of one’s mind. There is also another dimension called ‘spiritual reality’. To harmonize all of them is a great awakening.</p>
<p>Ordinary being loves one’s own ‘psycho dramas’ of justification, proving one’s point of view, blaming, being helpless… and this leads one to a state of inner poverty. To free oneself from these lower states of poverty and see them as ‘errors in one’s thinking’ is part of being effective and experiencing inner prosperity.</p>
<p>The profound teaching of Lord Shiva introduces us to A Bigger Container where one learns to be charitable to one’s own self. This practice of making A Bigger Container is essentially spiritual.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adi Shankaracharya composed a number of Vedantic works for imparting the knowledge of the Self. One of these hymns is the famous “Bhaja Govindam”.</p>
<p>‘Bhaja’ literally means ‘seek’, ‘Govindam’ means ‘the Lord’ – ‘the Truth’. The learned masters, out of deep compassion try to wake up humanity. They invite us to open our eyes to a higher dimension of living. The whole text of Bhaja Govindam in essence means ‘Wake up, seek the Lord, and stop seeking the primitive and superficial things in life.’</p>
<p>The compilation of thoughts presented in this book is applicable to one and all. Swami Sukhabodhananda in his unique style explains the verses with deep clarity and understanding.</p>
