										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Complete book of Sex Education is a complete source book for value-based, culture-specific and age-appropriate education in human sexuality. It discusses social, behavioral, relational, emotional and even legal aspects of human sexuality.</p>
<p>It is meant for the reference of adult sex-educators such as parents, teachers, doctors, counsellors, psychologists and social workers. Adult individuals and couples who seek to educate themselves can also refer to this book.</p>
<p>Great care has been taken to respect the sensibilities of all communities, groups and schools of thought in India; and to make it culture-specific yet contemporary, without compromising on the scientific accuracy of the subject.</p>
