										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Little Book of Science explains 175 laws, principles, equations, theories and things that form the foundations of science. It features all the great names in science, including Pythagoras, Galileo, Newton, Darwin and Einstein, as well as more recent contributors such as Rachel Carson, James Lovelock and Stephen Hawking.</p>
<p>This little book presents serious science simply, answering questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Pythagoras’ Theorem?</li>
<li>What is the difference between circadian rhythms and the popular concept of biorhythms?</li>
<li>What is the Black Hole Theory?</li>
<li>Who developed the World Wide Web?</li>
</ul>
<p>The book is arranged in chronological order. Read it from cover to cover curled up on the couch or dip into it at random when you have a spare moment. It’s an invaluable resource for students of all ages.</p>
