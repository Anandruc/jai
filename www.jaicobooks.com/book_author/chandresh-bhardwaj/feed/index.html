										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreword by his holiness The Dalai Lama</p>
<p>Have you ever felt like you’re living out of a script written for you by others – in your personal and professional life?</p>
<p>In Break the Norms, author Chandresh Bharadwaj explains that there are no right answers in spirituality, but asking the right questions can help you discover who you are and who you are becoming.</p>
<p>He illuminates the unconscious beliefs we carry about matters of sex, love, ego and death. He then offers self-inquiry practices to help you separate your own truth from the products of the status quo. This compelling book is a clarion call to embrace your own spiritual authority.</p>
<p>Overturn your assumptions and unlearn your suffering. Discover the real reason for being alive.</p>
