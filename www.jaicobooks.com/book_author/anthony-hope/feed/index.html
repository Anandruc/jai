										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jaico illustarted classics series is a collection of beloved children’s classics read by generations all over the world. Rich with adventures and thrills, these immortal stories with vivid illustrations are designed to delight young readers.</p>
<p>The Prisoner of Zenda tells the story of Rudolf Rassendyll, younger brother of the Earl of Burlesdon and a distant cousin of Rudolf V, the new King of Ruritania. Rassendyll is a peace-loving English gentleman who goes to Ruritania on a secret visit. By a strange quirk of fate, he happens to look like Rudolf V, the real heir to the throne of Ruritania. Rudolf V is imprisoned in the castle of Zenda by Black Michael, the evil Duke of Strelsau. Rudolf Rassendyll impersonates as Rudolf V and is coronated. He falls in love with a beautiful princess, but being duty-bound, he draws up a plan to free the real king from the clutches of Black Michael and restores him his kingdom.</p>
