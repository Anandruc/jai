										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just as there are certain laws that govern nature, there are laws that govern performance and achievement. Unfortunately, people are either unaware of them or they are not applying them. As a result, many people chase after goals, but the results they desire constantly elude them.</p>
<p>If you want to be someone, achieve something, or get somewhere in life, you must understand the governing laws that turn dreams into reality. Over the last few hundred years of recorded history, common denominators that lead to personal success have consistently surfaced. TJ Hoisington has gathered these distinctions into a single book to share with you.</p>
<p>The pages of this book are filled with moving stories and examples of success and failure that will inspire all who read them. The author shows you what habits must be formed and what steps must be taken to achieve any goal you set. Simple and concise, If You Think You Can! is the source that will help you achieve whatever you want.</p>
