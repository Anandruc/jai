										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By age 16, thousands more hours will have been spent by most of us in some form of disagreement with those in our extended social networks.</p>
<p>As a species, we’re well practised at falling out with each other. We may even have a gene for it – certainly, some of us seem to be gifted.<br />
When it comes to finding resolutions, however, things don&#8217;t come quite so naturally: as much as 90% of all interpersonal conflicts never reach agreement.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
<p>I Don’t Agree is a fascinating exploration of new, powerful and surprising solutions to an ancient problem: why we disagree so much. It shows how to sidestep our animosities and get great things done, despite our differences.</p>
<p>Underpinned by cutting-edge research and academic thinking (as well as fascinating real-life case studies and easy-to-use tools), author and marketeer Michael Brown reveals the eye-opening secrets that can lead to better leadership, stronger teams, swifter promotions, more effective collaboration, better organisational culture – as well as radically improving your life outside of work.</p>
