<p>Yuvraj had flair, power and a dazzling range of strokes that had critics and fans heaping encomiums on him. While he may not have quite lived up to early expectations, especially in Test cricket, Yuvraj has been brilliantly devastating in limited overs cricket, winning countless matches on his own.</p>
<p>But, there is more to the Yuvraj story than just his exploits on the pitch. There has been no more stirring saga in modern Indian sport than his comeback to international cricket after a year-long fight with cancer that had threatened to finish his career prematurely.</p>
<p>His six sixes in one over, off Stuart Broad in the 2007 T20 World Championship, is testimony to Yuvraj’s innate batting prowess, though this comes with a vexing poser – just why could he not replicate such form in Tests too? Perhaps, considering his new vigour, that time is now.</p>
<p>Ayaz Memon, one of India’s most prolific journalists, brings with him 33 years of experience in sports writing. He started his career covering sports and went on to edit newspapers like Mid-Day, Bombay Times and DNA as well as magazines like Sportsweek. Ayaz was also sports editor for the Times of India and the Independent at various stages. He is currently consulting editor with NewsX.</p>

<p>After making his mark at the junior level, when he led the Under-19 team to victory in the World Cup, Virat Kohli graduated into the senior ranks quite seamlessly and is now considered a pivotal player in the Indian team.</p>
<p>He played a significant role in the 2011 World Cup triumph and has since matured into a consistent match-winner in limited overs cricket and a highly reliable batsman in the longer version of the game. His brilliant fielding enhances manifold his value to the team.</p>
<p>Rated among the best young players in the world today, Kohli’s filmstar looks and dashing approach on the field make him hugely popular with both fans and brands. Not quite 25, he is sound on tactics, strong on fellow-player management and is already seen as the future captain of India.</p>
