										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bhagavad Gita : A Melody Divine<br />
Michelangelo said that inside every block of stone dwells a beautiful statue.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad Gita is a divine song that helps unravel the beauty within you. It helps you to discover the magic potency of self-governance. It enriches you from within. Carl Jung said, Who looks outside dreams, who looks inside awakes. The world converges to that rare person who has empowered himself and tapped his inner resources. Such a person achieves success effortlessly. He is happy and evolves to his full potential. Without cultivating your inner resources you feel inadequate, incomplete. It is only with inner unfoldment that you experience true power. You are not the human being going through a spiritual experience; you are the very Spirit. The Gita brings you back to the cognition of your true potential. You become a Perfect Person.</p>
