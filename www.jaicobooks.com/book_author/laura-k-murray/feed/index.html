										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beginning his career as a shy lawyer, Gandhi’s deep belief in justice helped him develop his philosophies about truth, tolerance, and nonviolence. He garnered supporters who wanted to follow his example of living simply, empowering others, and striving to unify all peoples.</p>
<p>Critics questioned his commitment to universal pacifism. Some even criticized him for focusing on initiatives besides India’s independence such as his involvement with the untouchables or his refusal to call for the elimination of India’s caste system altogether. Others held negative views of his political leadership and his perceived dedication to Indian nationalism over universal peace.</p>
<p>Yet, even today, Gandhi’s critics admit their admiration of his steadfast commitment to nonviolence. Read all about the remarkable journey of the flagbearer of nonviolent protests who was instrumental in India’s fight for independence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mother Teresa, or St. Teresa of Calcutta, was born Anjezë (Agnes) Bojaxhiu, in northern Macedonia, thousands of kilometers away from the city she later came to love and be associated with. Her journey—out of her small European village and to the ailing world as a young Catholic nun—was paved with struggles, both internal and external.</p>
<p>She is known as one of the greatest humanitarians in recent history. By the time of her death in 1997, she had captured the hearts of millions. Not everyone agreed she was worthy of praise, though. Criticisms of her work and motivations continued throughout her life and after her death. However, neither her critics nor her supporters knew that she had experienced a spiritual struggle for decades.</p>
<p>Regardless of criticism, wherever she went, she offered fervent prayers for peace and encouraged joy amidst suffering. Read all about the revered saint’s trials and tribulations in these pages.</p>
