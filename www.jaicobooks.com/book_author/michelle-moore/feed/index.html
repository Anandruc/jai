										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How can you get people to see things your way?<br />
What words can you use to convince and lead them to follow you?</p>
<p>Get others to do what you want using the power of persuasion.</p>
<p>The most successful people in history have one trait in common. They were all persuasive. This trait often makes or breaks success: the pure ability to win people over to our side. Become a master in both conscious and subconscious persuasion methods.</p>
<p>Presented in everyday, clear language, this book explores a revolutionary approach to persuading people. The Art of Persuasion will not only show you the science and psychology of persuasion, but also specific, no-nonsense tactics that you can use to magnetize and mesmerize people over and over again.</p>
