										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you been feeling miserable lately?<br />
And you can’t pinpoint why?<br />
There could be an underlying reason…</p>
<p>In Why Do I Feel So Sad? acclaimed psychiatrist Dr Shefali Batra explains the multidimensional causality of depression and its many faces. Through this book Dr Batra hopes to reach out to as many people as possible and spread awareness about those persistent blues that could come with tragic consequences if left undiagnosed.</p>
<p>She guides the reader on their journey to recovery by</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing time-tested, thought-based practices from modern research that can be used independently or alongside medication</li>
<li>Showing you how to identify twists in your thinking, overcome numbing pessimism and become proactive about your emotional wellness using cognitive behaviour techniques</li>
<li>Equipping you with tools such as checklists and worksheets to overpower depression if it has already struck or in preventing it altogether</li>
</ul>
<p>Foreword by Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Executive Chairperson, Biocon</p>
