										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreword By His Holiness The Dalai Lama</p>
<p>Preface by Rabbi David Rosen</p>
<p>Practical wisdom, a connection to the Divine, and global action – these are the traits of Pujya Swami Chidanand Saraswati that have made him one of India’s most renowned and beloved spiritual teachers. His lessons are profoundly simple, frequently wrapped in humor, and applicable to all.</p>
<p>By God’s Grace traces Pujya Swami’s story from the jungles of India to the company of various world leaders, from Himalayan villages to the podiums of the United Nations, the World Economic Forum and other venues of global exchange. His projects are unprecedented and include a clean-up of the 1,560-mile-long Ganges River and a six-million-word encyclopedia of Hinduism.</p>
<p>Accompanied by vivid photographs of various moments of his life, this book is a fascinating portrait of the achievements and teachings of an acclaimed spiritual pioneer. A vibrant picture of an impassioned life, By God’s Grace is a breathtaking tapestry of exotic journeys, meetings with remarkable people, and practical wisdom from his extraordinary life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sadhvi Bhagawati Saraswati, from Hollywood, California, had a privileged upbringing that hid some dark secrets. She grappled with an eating disorder and trauma from her early childhood for years. But, as a Stanford grad getting her PhD in Psychology, she felt she was successfully navigating adulthood. After getting married, when she agreed to travel to India to appease her husband, little did Sadhviji know a journey of healing and awakening awaited her. She had everything the material world could offer. Soon, she would give it all up to follow the divine path.</p>
<p>Hollywood to the Himalayas describes Sadhviji’s odyssey towards divine enlightenment and inspiration through her extraordinary connection with her guru and renewed confidence in the pleasure and joy that life can bring. Now one of the preeminent female spiritual teachers in the world, Sadhviji recounts her journey with wit, honesty, and clarity. Along the way, she offers teachings to help us all step onto our own path of awakening and discover the truth of who we really are—embodiments of the Divine.</p>
