										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all have people who drive us crazy. Perhaps it is a nasty neighbour or a politician whose views we abhor or an infuriating relative. Although we would rather live without the annoyances and the challenges these people present, they continue to cause us misery.</p>
<p>Worst Enemy, Best Teacher talks about not only how to cope with adversaries but also how to use their presence to improve and learn more about ourselves. The book explains how to turn conflicts into opportunities and vexing opponents into valuable teachers. Combining ancient combat techniques with recent brain research and universal mediation skills, author Deidre Combs provides straightforward methods to create calm and harmony in our lives.</p>
<p>Learn to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfortably deal with difficult people</li>
<li>Function better under stress</li>
<li>Improve your personal and professional relationships</li>
<li>Develop a greater sense of inner peace</li>
</ul>
