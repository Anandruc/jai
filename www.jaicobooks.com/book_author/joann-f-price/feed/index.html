He encourages cross-over appeal, discourse, affiliation, and has drawn many Americans, including today’s youth, into politics. This is the story of Barack Obama, a man of mixed race heritage who inspires, listens, compromises, and is often bipartisan.</p>
<p>From his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia to becoming the fifth African-American senator in U.S. history, and later, a presidential candidate, this well-researched biography traces his hardships and successes, the people who most influenced his career, his personal life and his meteoric rise to pop icon status. Rounded out with photos, a timeline, a bibliography and an index, here is a must-read for high school and undergraduate students of current events and political science.</p>
