<p>In this path-breaking book, Chanakya’s 7 Secrets of Leadership, author Radhakrishnan Pillai delves into Chanakya’s Saptanga with the real-life example of D. Sivanandhan. Former Director General of Police, Maharashtra, and the archetype of an able administrator, Sivanandhan shares his guidelines for effective management, highlighting those that make him a dynamic leader.</p>
<p>In Chanakya’s 7 Secrets of Leadership, theory meets practice, academic research meets vast experience in police supervision and an age-old formula is revealed in a modern-day success story. Together, Pillai and Sivanandhan bring Chanakya’s model to life.</p>
<p>Anyone can use the seven secrets of leadership to run a kingdom effectively. Apply them in your life, and the magic of Chanakya’s wisdom will transform you into the ideal leader.</p>
