<p>Edmond Dantes, an upcoming sailor with a bright future, is implicated by his three jealous friends for a crime he did not commit. He is imprisoned for life. In the prison, an old, dying mate incoherently tells him of a vast amount of treasure buried on the island of Monte Cristo. Dantes escapes after fourteen years in prison. Starting life all over again as a sailor, he eventually finds the treasure and becomes immensely rich, ruthless and powerful, donning the title of ‘Count’ with only one aim in life that is to seek revenge against three men responsible for his imprisonment. How he goes on to avenge the injustice and harm done to him is this story of The Count of Monte Cristo.</p>

<p>Who was the man in the iron mask? Why did he wear a mask? Why was he imprisoned and who imprisoned him? Nobody knows. His identity was a mystery when he lived and more than two and a half centuries later, he is still shrouded in mystery. Some people identify him with Duke of Mammoth, the illegitimate son of Charles II and some with Moliere, the creator of famous comedy “Tartuffe”. But Alexandre Dumas created this novel identifying the man in the iron mask as the twin brother of Louis XIV.</p>
