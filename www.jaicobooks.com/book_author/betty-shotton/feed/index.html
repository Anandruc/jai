										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In LiftOff Leadership, Betty Shotton examines 10 powerful principles such as vision, accountability and altruism and the important role they play in leadership. She insists that financial achievement alone doesn’t define leadership success – true success is measured by the quality of life a leader leaves behind.</p>
<p>LiftOff Leadership challenges readers to assess their leadership style and to embrace and elevate their capacity to lead through exercises and reflections. Shotton uses her own business background and first-person tales from the cockpit to illuminate the power of her 10 principles.</p>
<p>Powerful, provocative and practical, this book is a game-changer for leadership. A book every leader needs to read.</p>
