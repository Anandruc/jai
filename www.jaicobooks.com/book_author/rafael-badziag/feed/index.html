Never before has someone interviewed 20+ self-made billionaires across the world for a book project. The author worked for years with some of the very best entrepreneurs on the planet and distilled their secrets into 20 mental principles. The same principles enabled them to start from zero and create billions of dollars in value during one life span.</p>
<p>This book gives you the road map to follow their path to extreme wealth and success.</p>
