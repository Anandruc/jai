										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This charming collection of his prose and drama includes his most evocative works complete with his first, and only, novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, a tale of pure beauty and unadulterated decadence.</p>
<p>Also included are his fascinating short stories, like the delightful tale of The Happy Prince and the poignant satire, The Birthday of the Infanta with its much darker overtones. Among his plays are comedies such as Lady Windermere’s Fan and A Woman of No Importance, seemingly trivial but mercilessly exposing Victorian hypocrisies. The book also includes the controversial and macabre tragedy, Salomé which was designed to make his audience shudder by its depiction of unnatural passion.</p>
