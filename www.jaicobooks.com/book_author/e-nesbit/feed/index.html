										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Quite suddenly, a cloud passed over the sun, and the silence was broken by shrieks from far off; and, like a many-colored torrent, all the children burst from the wood and rushed, a red and blue and yellow and white wave, across the field, screaming as they ran. Their voices came up to the Princess on her tower, and she heard the words threaded on their screams like beads on sharp needles: “The dragon, the dragon, the dragon! Open the gates! The dragon is coming! The fiery dragon!”</p>
<p>The fire-breathing, winged supernatural beasts are out to create mischief and no one is safe when dragons are on the prowl…</p>
<p>In The Book of Dragons, with her extraordinary skill, the talented author E. Nesbit spins fantastic adventures through eight enchanting tales. The stories include The Book of Beasts, The Dragon Tamers, The Island of the Nine Whirlpools and others.</p>
<p>Come and join the roller coaster ride through a magical world full of thrilling encounters between quick-witted lads and feisty dragons. Strap on your safety belts and off you go on a wild escapade to tame a bunch of wicked dragons!</p>
