										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cancer: A Love Story is the intimately searing memoir of a four-time cancer survivor. The book breathlessly tracks author Lauren Segal’s journey to come to terms with the untold challenges of facing the dreaded disease. Forced to face her needle phobia, the author leads the reader into her crumbling world as she confronts the terrors of treatment—from debilitating chemo to nuking radiation. Death is her uninvited companion.</p>
<p>But in the midst of her lonely horror, in a quest for deeper meaning, Lauren discovers the unexpected gift of awareness of unanticipated opportunities that cancer presents—to confront her unmasked humanity—her fears, strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>“I have come to understand that in the same way that the majestic lotus flower has its roots in murky waters, so too does the emergence of beauty in life sometimes depend on life’s darker events.”</p>
