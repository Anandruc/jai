										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Myths offer truths that speak about the human condition and have withstood the test of time. The Mahabharata is one such magnificent saga and the Bhagavad Gita is the nectar of its distilled wisdom.</p>
<p>The great Indian gurus and philosophers have looked at the battle of Kurukshetra as a euphemism for the struggle within – between a person’s asuric (demonic) and daivic (divine) inclinations. Eons later, the Gita is still relevant and popular. Is it because we are still fascinated about an ancient war and a philosophical discourse that happened in the middle of a battlefield a long time ago, or because we are concerned about understanding the constant tussle between good and bad in our lives and in our own consciousness?</p>
