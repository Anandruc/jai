										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bestselling author Leonard Shlain explores the potential for humankind through the life, art, and mind of the first true Renaissance Man, Leonardo da Vinci. His innovations as an artist, scientist, and inventor are recast through a modern lens, with Shlain applying contemporary neuroscience to illuminate da Vinci’s creative process. No other person in human history has excelled in so many areas of innovation: Shlain reveals the how and the why.</p>
<p>Shlain theorizes that Leonardo’s extraordinary mind came from a uniquely developed and integrated right and left brain, which offers a model for how we too can evolve. Using past and current research, Leonardo’s Brain presents da Vinci as the focal point for a fresh exploration of human creativity. With his lucid style and remarkable ability to discern connections among a wide range of fields, Shlain brings the reader into the world of history’s greatest mind.</p>
