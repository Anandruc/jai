										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This book will be a total waste of time if you are</p>
<ul>
<li>Excited about slogging in a job for the rest of your life</li>
<li>Gratefully handing over your income to your mummy-papa to manage</li>
<li>Certain of winning the lottery or receiving a huge inheritance</li>
<li>A financial expert with your investments completely sorted</li>
</ul>
<p>Finance is intimidating, the products are complicated, salespeople are pushy, and the jargon is confusing. Well, not anymore! Three Pigs to Financial Freedom guides you on everything you need to know—how much money you need to be financially free, the accounts you need to open, the products you should buy, how much you should invest in them, and where you should get them. Using an incredibly easy and practical system, the book humorously demystifies financial planning in the Indian context. Best of all, you don’t need any knowledge of managing money to get started!</p>
