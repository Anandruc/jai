										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A colourfully dressed Bedouin, brandishing a sword and wearing an ancient symbol of Christianity, interrupted the breakfast of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson and admonished them. Soon after, Holmes and Watson are dispatched to the Vatican to investigate the murder of Cardinal Tosca, the successor to the pope.</p>
<p>Unearthing the Cardinal’s clandestine and dubious dealings right before his death leads them to a lost gospel arriving along with several other mysterious packages from Egypt. They conclude he was killed while translating the ancient scroll. When all clues point towards the involvement of their Bedouin intruder and an ‘unholy trinity’, they embark on a dangerous journey to Egypt to recover the stolen gospel and bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>
