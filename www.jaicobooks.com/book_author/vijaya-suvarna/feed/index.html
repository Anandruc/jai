										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every lie you tell leads to another one. Sometimes these are small white lies. Like not doing your homework or finishing the last piece of cake. But sometimes they are the big ugly ones – excuses for fear, incompetency and laziness. These are combined and disguised as Your Truths.</p>
<p>5 Break-Free Truths is an original approach to life that allows you to</p>
<ul>
<li>Confront your deepest fears and anxieties and do away with them</li>
<li>Take proactive steps to discover your true potential</li>
<li>Build long-lasting relationships with people and live life on your terms</li>
</ul>
<p>But most of all, it helps you differentiate Your Truth from The Truth so you can stop lying to yourself and face life head-on.</p>
<p>With anecdotes that will make you laugh, stories that will make you cry, insights that will make you think, incidences that will make you believe and The Truths that will make you introspect deeply, this powerful book will transform your life.</p>
