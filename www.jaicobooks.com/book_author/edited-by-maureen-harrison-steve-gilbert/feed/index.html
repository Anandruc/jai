										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now in Marathi</p>
<p>For someone who claimed he had been educated by “littles” – a little now and a little then – Abraham Lincoln displayed a remarkable facility in his use of the written word.</p>
<p>In the simple yet memorable eloquence of The Greatest Speeches of Abraham Lincoln, proclamations and personal correspondence are recorded in a representative collection of 22 documents.</p>
<p>This volume contains, complete and unabridged, the Address Before the Young Men’s Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois (1838), which emphasized a theme Lincoln was to return to repeatedly, namely, the capacity of a people to govern themselves; the First Inaugural Address (1861), in which he appealed to the people of an already divided union for sectional harmony; the Letter to Mrs Bixby (1864), expressing Lincoln’s regrets over the wartime deaths of her five sons and many more.</p>
<p>An invaluable reference for history students, this important volume will also fascinate admirers of Abraham Lincoln, Americana enthusiasts, Civil War buffs and any lover of the finely crafted phrase.</p>
