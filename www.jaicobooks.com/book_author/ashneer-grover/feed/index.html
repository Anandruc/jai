										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the unfettered story of Ashneer Grover-the favourite and misunderstood poster boy of Start-up India.<br />
Raw, gut-wrenching in its honesty and completely from the heart, this is storytelling at its finest.</p>
<p>A young boy with a &#8216;refugee&#8217; tag growing up in Delhi&#8217;s Malviya Nagar outpaces his circumstances by becoming a rank-holder at the pinnacle of academic excellence in India-IIT Delhi. He goes on to do an MBA from the hallowed halls of IIM Ahmedabad, builds a career as an investment banker at Kotak Investment Banking and AmEx, and is pivotal in the making of two unicorns-Grofers, as CFO, and BharatPe, as co-founder.</p>
<p>As a judge on the popular TV show Shark Tank India, Ashneer becomes a household name even as his life turns upside down. Controversy, media spotlight, garrulous social media chatter descend, making it difficult to distinguish fact from fiction.</p>
