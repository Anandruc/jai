										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Science and technology have brought us forward into a grand new world with greater opportunities than ever before. But our attitudes and feelings have not evolved equally. The solution is to look from another perspective. Through this, we are moved to new emotions and behaviours.</p>
<p>So what would be the reactions of an intelligent visitor from another planet to our complex systems here on Earth? How would we view that visitor’s culture? Are we ready to accept an objective view?</p>
<p>Out of this World is the encounter and exchange between a citizen of Earth and Uranus. Peaceful, open, life-loving people who seek to enhance the well-being of all, the two innocuously observe our society and through that, reveal our realities.</p>
<p>This book is a classic parable that bares humankind’s limitless possibilities as it seamlessly slips you into the role of an observer and invites you to look within.</p>
