										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the mid-1700s, the famed poet of Kerala, Kunjan Nambiar, composed an eloquent work on the heroics of Krishna in the literary style called Mani-Pravalam — a composite of the two languages, Sanskrit and Malayalam.</p>
<p>Titled Krishna Charitam, this epic begins with the birth of Krishna, meanders through his loveable pranks and later, through his amorous interludes with the milkmaids of Vrindavan.</p>
<p>The fast-moving narrative takes readers through many of Krishna’s other adventures, such as his fight with the giant serpent Kaliya; his defeat of the evil king Kamsa; his marriage to the beautiful princess Rukmini; his encounter with Jambavan, King of the bears; and his many efforts to establish dharma. Many lesser-known stories are also told, such as the episode where he retrieves ten dead children from the land of Vishnu.<br />
All these narratives are interspersed with abundant humour, delightful descriptions of nature as well as numerous proverbs and pithy urgings.</p>
<p>For many years, this great poem remained locked in the language of Mani-Pravalam, enjoyed only by a regional community. Now, this English translation opens up that enchanting world of Krishna to a wider audience.</p>
