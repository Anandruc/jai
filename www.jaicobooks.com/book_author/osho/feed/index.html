										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This series of questions and answers reveals the unique relationship of immense love and trust between Osho and those who ask him for guidance on their path. Osho illuminates the very essence of each question and gives his uniquely tailored responses to such topics as: the meditative qualities of the new man; the art of being fully alive; the misuse of power and how power can be used creatively. He inspires all who are courageous enough to take a step upon the unknown spiritual path. A path which, because unknown, can feel both perilous and ecstatic—as if being on the razor’s edge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talks on Ko Hsuan’s The Classic of Purity</p>
<p>“Tao seems to be the only life vision which is total. It does not deny the earth, it does not deny the sky. It accepts both, it accepts the<br />
unity of both. It says the man who has come to know spontaneous purity and stillness, who has become relaxed with the whole, with<br />
the law of the ultimate—in him heaven and earth are united. “I believe in the whole. To me, to trust the whole is the only way to be holy and to trust the whole is the only way to be whole. And when you are whole, life is bliss, life is benediction, life is a celebration.”<br />
-Osho</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For over 35 years, Osho spoke to international audiences of seekers, addressing their essential questions and concerns. The international press calls him “A 21st Century Prophet” and “an oracle of modern times.” His books and audio lectures are international bestsellers.</p>
<p>Osho himself says that he is neither a prophet nor a philosopher; he is simply sharing his own experience. The Sunday Times of London described him as “one of the 1000 makers of the 20th century” and American author Tom Robbins has called him “the most dangerous man since Jesus Christ”—both comments reflecting the profound influence of his revolutionary approach to the science of inner transformation.</p>
<p>Spoken with authority, clarity, sharpness and humor, his insights address both the timeless and timely concerns that tend to escape our notice in the clamor and overload of daily life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White Lotus is a beautiful symbol. White represents multidimensionality, because white contains all the colors of the spectrum. That is the most strange, unbelievable quality about white: it contains all the colors yet it seems to be colorless. But it contains all those colors in such synthesis, in such harmony, that they all disappear. They dissolve into oneness and that oneness is white. White represents the ultimate synthesis and harmony.</p>
<p>And the lotus also is a great symbol, particularly in the East. The Lotus represents the essential meaning of sannyas. The lotus lives in the lake and yet the water cannot touch it. it lives in the water and yet remains untouched by the water. The lotus represents the witnessing quality of your being: you live in the world, but you remain a witness. You remain in the world and yet you are not part of it. You participate and yet you are not part of it. You are in the world, but the world is not in you.</p>
<p>When you become a calm and cool observer of life you are going to laugh &#8211; not ordinarily laughter but a belly laughter like a lion’s roar. And white Lotuses will start showering on you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In The First Principle, Osho captures the unique, colorful, seemingly crazy spirit of Zen through talks on a collection of Zen stories – anecdotes of the often-bizarre interchanges between a master and disciple in the quest for truth. From these anecdotes, Osho distills Zen’s pragmatic essence for the reader and conveys an alive understanding of its message – “the first principle.”</p>
<p>Speaking to the contemporary, modern reader without robbing these old tales of their magic, charm and humor, Osho reminds us: “You are the shrine for the first principle. So the only way is to go within. Turn in. That is what meditation is all about.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This quest has been going on for countless lives. Sometimes you call it the search for truth. But you have never known truth, so how can you lose it? And sometimes you search for God. But your meeting with Him has never taken place, so how can you be separated from Him?</p>
<p>You go in search to the temples, to the mosques, to Kashi and to Mecca; you knock on every door you come across in the hope you will find what you have lost. But as long as you do not know exactly what it is you have lost your search cannot be fulfilled. Love is the ability to experience. Love is sensitivity. Love is the experience in which all your impurities are washed away and you throw open all your doors, all your gates. Then whosoever stands at your door is no longer an enemy or a friend but a beloved, and you open your door to him.</p>
<p>When you begin to feel the whole world is yours, when you begin to see the beloved in whosoever comes to your door, when you no longer see strangers or enemies, when you begin to see only friends everywhere – when this phenomenon takes place in you, know that you have found love.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last morning star symbolizes all that is ephemeral in the world. Talking on the playful and provocative poetry of Daya, Osho takes us on a journey from the transient, outer world to the eternal, boundless world within. This is a journey of the heart – the joyous, spontaneous, and at times uncompromising way of an enlightened woman mystic.</p>
<p>“If someone clings to the last morning star, how long will their happiness last? It is like catching a bubble of water. The bubble will burst before you can even hold it. You can try in thousands of ways to make it stay, but it will not stay. And this is what we are always doing – the whole world does it. What are the things that we try to hold on to? Relationships, attachments, love, our husband or wife, sons and daughters, wealth and riches, fame, position, prestige…”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This book is a pilgrimage in search of that indefinable something that all of us, at some time or other in our lives, feel is missing – what Osho describes as our “hidden splendor.”</p>
<p>“You go on missing something – something that you had known but you have forgotten – a faded memory, a lost remembrance. And the gap is not only a gap, it is a wound. It hurts, because you had brought something with your birth into the world and you have lost it somewhere. And it seems impossible to find it in this crowded universe. But unless it happens, your life has been in vain, a misery, a suffering, a futile longing, a meaningless desire, a thirst that you know cannot be quenched.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this book, Osho says of Light on the Path, “It is born out of those few essential words that man discovers again and again, and loses again and again. Mabel Collins says that she is not the author of the words that are collected in this booklet, that she has only seen them in the depths of meditation. She says, and rightly so, that these words are from a lost Sanskrit booklet.” </p>

<p>&#8220;When you fall within yourself, sooner or later the form will be lost, the name will be lost, because they exist only on the surface. The deeper you drown the more you come nearer to god – god as existence, not as a person.&#8221;- Osho</p>
<p>Despite being many thousands of years old. They are direct transmissions of truth – and truth is eternal, above religious dogma and tradition – but because of their antiquity, they can appear cloaked in a mysterious language, which can be hard to understand. Osho, with his fresh and sometimes irreverent approach, brings the Kenopanishad up-to-date.</p>
</div>
<p>Because Osho can so easily go beyond the intellect, his presentation of this ancient treatise is unlike anything coming from the academic world. For those familiar with exploring ideas through the intellect, this book could be an ideal way to discover what they have been missing. One can open the book to almost any page and be astonished by the brilliance of the insights.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Become natural, become ordinary; live in equanimity, and do not remain unacquainted with the secret that is hidden within you. The moment you become acquainted with it, a great revolution will take place, the revolution which turns dirt into gold, which turns an ordinary man into a buddha, which picks you up from the ground and takes you to the heights of the stars in the sky.</p>
<p>I have moved around the world saying only this one thing, and have been amazed and astonished that people are not ready to hear it. People close their doors, countries close their doors, because what will happen then to their religions, to their religious scriptures? I know only one scripture. That is you.”<br />
— Osho</p>
<p>IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS from individuals and members of the press, Osho speaks on the essential and timeless path of meditation – focusing on India’s ancient heritage of inquiry into transforming human consciousness, of going within ourselves rather than looking to the outer world for fulfillment and recognition.</p>
<p>Set against the backdrop of his return to India after having been illegally deported from the United States, and after a subsequent “World Tour” where he was denied entry to 21 countries, Osho uses those recent experiences to highlight his essential message for the whole of humanity – to grow in consciousness, to discover individual freedom and truth through tapping into our inner treasure of awareness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is a book for today, a much-needed declaration that for humans there is hope, there is a way forward! Osho offers a revolutionary approach to the eternal quest that mankind carries within. As he says: “Life has intrinsic value, there is no goal outside it. Hence my whole effort is to change everything into playfulness. To me that is real spirituality.”</p>
<p>“Awake and claim your birthright. Religion is not anybody’s monopoly, it is everybody’s birthright. It has no name, no church, no organization. It is a sheer rebellion against all churches, all organizations, all scriptures. It is meeting existence directly and immediately, in innocence, in gratitude, in love, in a deep communion. This is the prayer I would like to spread all over the earth. Because this is the only prayer that can save it.”<br />
—Osho</p>
