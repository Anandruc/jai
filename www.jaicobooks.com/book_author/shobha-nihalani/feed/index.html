										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An age-old scroll is discovered in the hidden chambers of the Taj Mahal. The journalist who finds the ancient artifact is murdered. His feisty widow Manzil is suddenly burdened with the deadly secret, the contents of which could rock the nation. She becomes the most wanted person in the country.</p>
<p>Threatened by fanatics, confronted by archaeologists, coerced by the police and under surveillance by a political organization with a hidden agenda, Manzil can trust no one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the backdrop of a frenetic world, Rev. Dada J.P. Vaswani is a soothing presence who radiates love like a powerful beacon, effecting change in anyone who comes within his sphere. A mystic philosopher, he is a saint to some people, but to countless others he is simply Dada.</p>
<p>Dada Vaswani: A Life in Spirituality offers an unusual viewpoint – a nonbeliever’s perspective, it takes a fresh look at spirituality. The author creates a mischievous being who flits about and hovers – doubting and cynical – observing Dada as he follows his own convictions with implicit courage and faith.</p>
<p>Known for her adventure and thriller novels, Shobha Nihalani says that meeting Dada J, as she calls him, was a turning point in her journey as an author. His open heart and inner strength inspired her to grow spiritually and take on the immense task of penning the story of his life. Through this book, we are welcomed into Dada Vaswani’s life to witness his selfless service and dedicated mission to build love, forgiveness, and unity.</p>
