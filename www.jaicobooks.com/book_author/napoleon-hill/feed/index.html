										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Napoleon Hill’s classic Think &amp; Grow Rich ! has made more millionaires and inspired more successes than any other book in history.</p>
<p>For three decades Napoleon Hill collaborated with America’s most creative and successful entrepreneurs, learning firsthand why they succeeded while others failed. Some of the most famous self-made multimillionaires personally revealed to Hill the secrets they had used to pull themselves out of poverty and create their own success.</p>
<p>More than a self-improvement book, Think &amp; Grow Rich ! offers you a complete philosophy of personal achievement. It will teach you methods to create a success-consciousness within yourself, and it will provide you with a detailed blueprint for achieving that success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>365 Days of Inspiration combine Dr. Napoleon Hill’s maxims with time tested thoughts from around the world. Motivational ideas in literary works and spiritual writings abound now and in ages past. Linking these thoughts together gives the reader additional insight, depth of understanding, and an opportunity to assimilate the short message and make it their own.</p>
<p>At one point in time, Dr. Hill called these maxims “Mental Vitamins.” Good thoughts produce good outcomes. W. Clement Stone, Dr. Hill’s friend and business partner, states: “In a novel, the author writes the conclusion; in a self-help book, the reader writes the conclusion by the action he takes.” What you think about, you become. Think on these things, and become the very best you can be! Do it now!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you are a student, a businessman, an entrepreneur, or a teacher, you will glean much information from the shared material in this volume. By using the shared secrets uncovered during his lifetime of research and practice, Napoleon Hill guides you step-by- step in becoming the person you were meant to be.</p>
<p>There are 52 chapters – that equates to one per week. Read a little, reflect a lot, and then when you uncover the secret, put it into immediate action. As Dr. Hill states: When a plan comes through to your conscious mind while you are open to the guidance of Infinite Intelligence, accept it with appreciation and gratitude and act on it at once. Do not hesitate, do not argue, challenge, worry, fret about it, or wonder if it’s right. Act on it!</p>
<p>Enjoy your journey. Enjoy the book.</p>
