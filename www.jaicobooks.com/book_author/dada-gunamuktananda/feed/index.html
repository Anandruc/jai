										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Based on the popular TEDx talk of the same name, Consciousness: The Final Frontier takes us on a journey of self-discovery.</p>
<p>Merging the esoteric and the mundane, tapping into ancient and contemporary wisdom, and using real-life examples, Dada Gunamuktananda explores the concept of our own consciousness as part of—indeed one with—a conscious universe. He shows how to connect with the supreme teacher within us through simple and sustainable changes to our daily life. These changes include following a yogic lifestyle, practising meditation, maintaining good hygiene and health, among others.</p>
<p>This book not only puts forth the case for a conscious universe and how a life lived in consciousness leads to inner peace, love and fulfilment within oneself, but also how these positive feelings can overflow into love and compassion for all.</p>
<p>Combining philosophy and practice, Dada explains how even in times of crisis—even amidst the life challenges of today’s world—it is possible to not just survive but to thrive and strive for a better self and a better world.</p>
