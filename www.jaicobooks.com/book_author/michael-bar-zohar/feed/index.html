<p>For decades, Israel’s renowned security arm, the Mossad, has been widely recognized as the best intelligence service in the world. In Mossad, authors Michael Bar-Zohar and Nissim Mishal take us behind the closed curtain with riveting, eye-opening, boots-on-the-ground accounts of the most dangerous, most crucial missions in the agency&#8217;s 60-year history.</p>
<p>These are real, true Mission: Impossible stories brimming with high-octane action – right from the breath-taking capture of Nazi executioner Adolph Eichmann to the recent elimination of key Iranian nuclear scientists. If you are fascinated by the world of international espionage, intelligence, and covert “Black-Ops” warfare, then you will definitely find that the Mossad makes for some electrifying reading.</p>
