										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The deadly Halahala, the all-devouring poison churned from the depths of the White Lake by the devas and asuras, was swallowed by Shiva to save the universe from extinction.</p>
<p>But was the Halahala truly destroyed?</p>
<p>A small portion still remains—a weapon powerful enough to guarantee victory to whoever possesses it. And both asuras and devas, locked in battle for supremacy, will stop at nothing to claim it.</p>
<p>As the forces of Devaloka and Patala, led by Indra and Shukracharya, plot to possess the Halahala, Shiva turns to mankind to guard it from their murderous clutches. It is now up to Samrat Vikramaditya and his Council of Nine to quell the supernatural hordes—and prevent the universe from tumbling into chaos! The Guardians of the Halahala is a sweeping tale of honour and courage in the face of infinite greed, danger and deceit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vikramaditya and his Council of Nine have fought valiantly to repel the rampaging hordes from Devaloka and Patala—but Avanti has been brought to its knees. Ujjayini lies battered; its citizens are scared, and morale is badly shaken. Meanwhile, the barbaric Hunas and Sakas are gathering on the horizon, and cracks are emerging between the allied kingdoms of Sindhuvarta&#8230;</p>
<p>The only silver lining is that the deadly Halahala is safe. For now.</p>
<p>Bent on vengeance, Indra is already scheming to destroy Vikramaditya, while Shukracharya has a plan that can spell doom for the Guardians of the Halahala. How long can the human army hold out against the ferocity and cunning of the devas and asuras? And will Vikramaditya’s love for his queen come in the way of his promise to Shiva?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In their greed to possess the deadly Halahala, the devas and the asuras have employed every dirty trick against Vikramaditya and his Council of Nine. But the humans are still standing, bloodied but unbowed.</p>
<p>When the wily Shukracharya discovers the secret to breaking the Council’s unity and strength, he forges an unlikely alliance with his arch-enemy, Indra, to set a deceitful plan in motion.</p>
<p>As cracks emerge between the councilors and their king, ghosts from the past threaten to ruin Vikramaditya and Kalidasa’s friendship, signalling the beginning of an eclipse that will cast a long shadow over all that Vikramaditya holds dear. And into this shadow steps Indra, bearing an old grudge—and a devastating new weapon.</p>
<p>How much longer before the Guardians of the Halahala finally fall apart?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shukracharya’s plan to break the unity of Vikramaditya’s Council has borne bitter fruit. Friends have become sworn enemies, and brother has turned against brother, setting Avanti on the path to self-destruction.</p>
<p>Even as Vikramaditya prepares to counter a Huna invasion, a rebellion brews within Ujjayini, while a devious conspiracy is hatched to humiliate him. With Indra’s spies swarming the palace and Shukracharya making a bold bid to take the Halahala, the king is dangerously close to the brink of defeat.</p>
<p>Alone and abandoned by those dear to him, fighting to protect his people, trying his best to keep his promise to Shiva, will the samrat rise one last time to defend his love, his city and his honour?</p>
<p>As the asura and deva forces muster in a final, desperate gamble to claim the Halahala, The Wrath of the Hellfires brings an explosive conclusion to Vikramaditya’s epic tale of action and adventure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bharat’s carefree life in Kekeya is turned upside down by the death of his father Raja Dashratha and the exile of his brother and crown prince Rama. Untrained in statecraft and unsure of himself, Bharat begins his rule over Kosala by tackling an audacious rakshasa attack on Ayodhya.</p>
<p>There’s more trouble brewing. As the magic that sustains the kingdom starts weakening and a drought looms over Kosala, Ayodhya’s citizens begin to disappear mysteriously. Ambitious aristocrats manipulate the inexperienced king to their ends, while fickle allies seize the opportunity to assert their independence. And unknown to Bharat, the Lord of Lanka has put a cunning plan into action that will break the back of Ayodhya’s resistance.</p>
<p>Beset by challenges, will Bharat lose Ayodhya so early in his reign?</p>
<p>Crackling with characters overlooked and forgotten by the Ramayana, The Warlord of Ayodhya is a thrilling spinoff by bestselling fantasy author Shatrujeet Nath.</p>
