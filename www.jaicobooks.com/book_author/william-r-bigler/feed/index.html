										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strategy execution has far more potential for value creation than does strategy formulation. This book offers a complete tool kit to help firms achieve world-class strategy execution status. It focuses on initiative management, aligning executive, operating, and support processes with market rhythms, the seven stages of business growth, and time-phasing initiatives with the competitive realities of the firm’s environment. It also demonstrates how to track the ripple effects of change throughout the organization.</p>
<p>Numerous exhibits portray tools that can be used by firms to develop world-class strategy execution prowess. A glossary of new terms and new definitions of familiar terms is included, along with a diagnostic survey that a firm can use to assess its current status regarding its world-class strategy execution abilities. The authors also provide a 10-S model of management imperatives that updates the McKinsey 7-S model from the 1980s. If a firm has been bogged down for too long in strategy formulation, now is the time to begin the execution phase – using this book as a starting point will give any organization the advantages it needs to launch this initiative successfully.</p>
