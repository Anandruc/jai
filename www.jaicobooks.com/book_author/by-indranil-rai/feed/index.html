<p>‘When India won the Cricket World Cup in 2011, an abiding image from the celebrations was of the Indian cricket team carrying Sachin Tendulkar on their shoulders around Wankhede stadium. Tendulkar was not the captain of the team and the victory had been a team effort. But for the players, the victory was a gift to a man, arguably India’s greatest cricketer and inarguably one of the very greatest in the world.’</p>
<p>Sachin Tendulkar’s story may have been told many times, but it never stops delighting the cricket fan. In the 25 years that Tendulkar has played cricket, there is almost no existing batting record that he has not broken, or no impossible record that he has not set. He has even changed the way money and endorsements entered the game. At the same time, his incredible batting skills have kept him rooted in the fine traditions of cricket.</p>
<p>Some say that one runs out of words when describing Sachin Tendulkar’s prowess and achievements. Others may more emphatically claim that there simply aren’t enough words to talk about this incredible cricketer.</p>

<p>On the football field of a beautiful small town in the Chhota Nagpur region, young schoolboy Mahendra Singh Dhoni was a goalkeeper&#8230;</p>
<p>From here on, the story of Dhoni has been nothing short of magical. Not only did he become captain of a successful Indian cricket team, he moulded that captaincy to his own image, with his strength, conviction and daring strategies.</p>
<p>Everything about MS Dhoni, from his early years to his trajectory towards stardom, from his fearless and indomitable batting skills to his courageous captaincy is here in this biography of one of India’s most recognizable cricketing icons. Not for nothing is he known as Captain Cool, for Dhoni brought home cricket’s most coveted trophies to India, from the World Cup to the inaugural T20 Championship.</p>
<p>In the words of Ian Chappell, after India’s World Cup victory, “Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s polished performance as skipper, where he pushed, prodded and cajoled his side into peaking at the right time, has shown he’s not only the best leader in the game, but also one of the finest of the last 30 years.”</p>
