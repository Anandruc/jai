										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> There is no religion in this book. There are no rituals prescribed here. There is no deep meditation being described here and neither is there any mention to any spiritual practice. This is not a guidebook. This is not a “self-help” book. It is not going to give you “an instant formula for joy”. But it will surely make you explore your Joy for yourself in a very direct way. The simple, short snippets of daily lives connected with what Sadhguru has to say about Joy, will take you on a wonderful roller coaster ride on Joy with the Master himself. With Sadhguru’s incredible clarity of expression, his brilliant wit and sense of observation, his ability to bring the most profound aspect in a very simple and direct way, this book is for any human being who seeks to be Joyful. No matter who you are, what you are trying to do, Sadhguru’s words will touch a wonderful wave of Joy inside you and you will soon be restless to seek Joy 24&#215;7.</p>
