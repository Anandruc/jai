										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sparks of Divinity, compiled by Noëlle Perez-Christiaens, is a collection of the teachings of yoga master B. K. S. Iyengar that shows his way of looking at the world, his philosophy of yoga, his devotion to the Divine and his love for human beings.</p>
<p>This book is an intimate glimpse into Iyengar’s personal life and family, and into the formative years of his career. Whether it was when Iyengar was invited by Yehudi Menuin to teach in Gstaad, Switzerland or the opening of the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute in Pune, this book covers some of the key aspects of Iyengar’s life.</p>
<p>Through Perez-Christiaens’ notes and pictures, we see Iyengar fully involved while teaching yoga, helping his student, or even performing a specific pose with her.</p>
