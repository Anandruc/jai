										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New edition</p>
<p>Gandhi’s face is instantly recognizable. But who was he? How did this young lawyer transform into the ‘great soul’ who led 400 million Indians in their nonviolent struggle for independence?</p>
<p>Easwaran, who grew up in Gandhi’s India, offers answers which are important both historically and personally. He gives a moving account of the turning points and choices in Gandhi’s life that made him not just a great political leader but also a timeless icon of nonviolence.</p>
<p>Gandhi’s inner transformation, the essence of this biography, contains an urgent message for us today. Non-violence, Easwaran explains, is a practical method for resolving problems, healing relationships, and raising the quality of our lives. It is a skill that is essential for the evolution, and perhaps even the survival, of our civilization.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meditation is a systematic technique for training the mind, especially attention and the will, so that we can set forth from the surface level of consciousness and journey into the very depths. With meditation you train your attention, drawing together the scattered threads of what you think, say and do.</p>
<p>The Principle of Meditation is simple: You are what you think. By meditating regularly, you find yourself becoming wiser, kinder, with greater sense of purpose and connection to others.</p>
<p>This book is a complete guide to a program of meditation developed by Eknath Easwaran.<br />
— Universal and dogma-free, meditation fits within any religious practice or nonreligious philosophy; it is used by counselors and yoga teachers, as well as health and education professionals.<br />
— Eknath Easwaran taught meditation to thousands of people for over 40 years, including a course at the University of California.<br />
— Thoroughly tested, consistent and clear, the instructions in this book are all you need to start meditating.</p>
<p>With Easwaran’s help, choose words or passages that appeal to you, from one spiritual tradition or many, poetic or intellectual, lofty and inspiring or warmly practical.</p>
<p>Keep meditating, and your words or passages will become lifelines, taking you to the source of wisdom deep within and then guiding you through the challenges of daily life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In extraordinary visions, they experience directly a transcendent Reality which is the essence, or Self, of each created being. They teach that each of us, each Self, is eternal, deathless, one with the power that created the universe.</p>
<p>Easwaran’s translation is reliable and readable, consistently the bestseller in its field. It includes an overview of the cultural and historical setting, with chapter introductions, notes, and a Sanskrit glossary. But it is Easwaran’s understanding of the wisdom of the Upanishads, and their relevance to the modern reader, that makes this edition truly outstanding.</p>
<p>Each sage, each Upanishad, appeals in different ways to the reader’s head and heart. In the end, Easwaran writes, “The Upanishads belong not just to Hinduism. They are India’s precious legacy to humanity, and in that spirit they are offered here.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Easwaran’s introduction to the Dhammapada gives an overview of the Buddha’s teachings that is reliable, penetrating, and clear – accessible for readers new to Buddhism, but also with fresh insights and practical applications for readers familiar with this text. Chapter introductions place individual verses into the context of the broader Buddhist canon. Easwaran is a master storyteller, and the introduction includes many stories that make moving, memorable reading, bringing young Siddhartha and his heroic spiritual quest vividly to life.</p>
<p>But Easwaran’s main qualification for interpreting the Dhammapada, he said, was that he knew from his own experience that these verses could transform our lives. This faithful rendition brings us closer to the compassionate heart of the Buddha.</p>

<p>Many cautioned Gandhi against involving in his nonviolent struggle these people with such a record of brutality. But under Khan’s leadership the Pathans proved that it is often those who are capable of great violence who have the courage to stand unarmed against injustice.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eknath Easwaran points out, the Gita is not what it seems – it’s not a dialogue between two mythical figures at the dawn of Indian history.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad Gita, ‘The Song of the Lord,’ is the best known of all the Indian scriptures, and Eknath Easwaran’s reliable, readable version has consistently been the bestselling translation.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad Gita opens, dramatically, on a battlefield, as the warrior Arjuna turns in anguish to his spiritual guide, Sri Krishna, for answers to the fundamental questions of life.</p>
<p>Easwaran’s introduction places the Gita in its historical setting and brings out the universality and timelessness of its teachings. Chapter introductions give clear explanations of key concepts, and notes and a glossary explain Sanskrit terms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feeling trapped by unwanted thoughts and emotions can seem an inevitable part of life. But Easwaran, who taught meditation for nearly forty years, shows a way to break free. Just as a fitness routine can create a strong, supple body, spiritual disciplines can shape a secure personality and a resilient, loving mind.</p>
<p>Writing as an experienced, friendly coach, Easwaran explains how we can train the mind not just during meditation but throughout the day. Working with difficult colleagues, choosing what to eat, and listening to a child’s needs are all opportunities to try out different, wiser responses.</p>
<p>To shed light on the thinking process, Easwaran takes the timeless teachings of the Buddha and other mystics and illustrates them with scenes from contemporary life. He offers practical exercises for taking charge of our thoughts, along with instruction in his own method of passage meditation. Easwaran shows how training the mind is a glorious challenge &#8211; one that brings joy and purpose to life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Easwaran, a foremost translator of the Gita, who taught classes on it for over 40 years, the Gita’s epic battle represents the war in our own hearts and Arjuna’s anguish reflects the human condition: torn between opposing forces, confused about how to live. Sri Krishna’s timeless guidance, Easwaran argues, can shed light on our dilemmas today.</p>
<p>Placing the Gita’s teachings in a modern context, Easwaran explores the nature of reality, the illusion of separateness, the search for identity, the meaning of yoga, and how to heal the unconscious. This book is his distillation of the Gita’s teachings from the end of his life, based on talks given to his close students and published here for the first time. Easwaran shows how, through the principles of yoga and the practice of meditation, the Gita can point a way forward for us, both as individuals and in society today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Easwaran presents the Dhammapada as a guide to spiritual perseverance, progress, and ultimately enlightenment – a heroic confrontation with life as it really is, with straight answers to our deepest questions. We witness the heartbreak of death, for instance – what does that mean for us? What is love? How does karma work? How do we follow the spiritual life in the midst of work and family? Does nirvana really exist, and if so, what is it like to be illumined?</p>
<p>In his interpretation of Buddhist themes, illustrated with stories from the Buddha’s life, Easwaran offers a view of the concept of Right Understanding that is both exhilarating and instructive. He shares his experiences on the spiritual path, giving the advice that only an experienced teacher and practitioner can offer, and urges us to answer for ourselves the Buddha’s call to nirvana – that mysterious, enduring state of wisdom, joy, and peace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every religion in the world worships their God with a different name. Words like ‘Holy, Merciful, Compassionate, Truth, and the One’ appear in all these religions, emphasizing that however we worship, the Lord is one and the same.</p>
<p>In India, one of the most popular litanies is the thousand names of Vishnu. He is worshipped by millions in his incarnations as Rama and Krishna. Eknath Easwaran comments on a fraction of these names and what each one means in our daily lives. This is a book for daily inspiration, full of personal reminders of what it means to see God in the faces and events of everyday life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>3 Volume Set</p>
<p>This verse-by-verse translation and commentary illustrates the Gita’s lofty insight with everyday events and contemporary problems familiar to all of us. Full of insights, stories and practical spiritual exercises, each volume of this set covers six chapters of the Gita and can be read on its own. The three volumes of The Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living together form a comprehensive manual for living a spiritual life.</p>
<p>VOLUME I: THE END OF SORROW</p>
<p>The End of Sorrow, the first volume of The Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living, concentrates on the individual: the nature of our innermost Self, how it can be discovered in the depths of consciousness and how this discovery transforms daily life. The introduction includes instructions in Easwaran’s universal method of passage meditation.</p>
<p>VOLUME II: LIKE A THOUSAND SUNS</p>
<p>Like a Thousand Suns, the second volume of The Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living, bridges scientific knowledge, spiritual understanding and the indivisible unity governing all creations. Easwaran illustrates the steps we can take to realise this unity and heal divisions within society and in ourselves.</p>
<p>VOLUME III: TO LOVE IS TO KNOW ME</p>
<p>To Love Is to Know Me, the third volume of The Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living, is global in scope but its emphasis is on individuals: what you and I can do. Easwaran presents life as a field where actions and desires are sown like seeds, which germinate, grow and yield fruits that eventually scatter more seeds. This vast network of cause and effect is what the Sanskrit word Karma denotes, and Easwaran offers many examples to illustrate its immense reach and “how everyday choices, taken together, can lead a society to violence and waste or to a higher way of living.”</p>
