										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a major nervous breakdown, stripped naked of the celebrity mask, Andreea has the courage to state the obvious: the desire to attain perfection is self-destructive. She proposes, instead, this book, which is like a map. If you go on this journey, you will find out how to take care of yourself in body, mind and spirit.</p>
<p>This book is an honest journal of shared experiences. Andreea convinces you that your body is your buddy. The fragments of beauty in each one of us come to light when we find the power to consciously live in the present and show gratitude for every new day.</p>
<p>But to learn to love your best friend, the one that is looking at you from inside the mirror, you first have toâ€¦ discover yourself!</p>
