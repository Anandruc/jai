										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On 12 April 2015, casting herself as the champion of the common American, Hillary Clinton formally announced her intention to run for President in 2016. With her core principles unchanged, Hillary seems all set to secure the one role she has long desired.</p>
<p>What drives this most intriguing and polarizing of political figures? Will she be able to shake off the past and finally emerge a winner? What are her chances of winning the title? And most importantly, what kind of President would she make? The questions are endless.</p>
