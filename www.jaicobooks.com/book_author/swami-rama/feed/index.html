<p>“I will tell you how I grew up and how I was trained, about the great sages with whom I lived and what they taught me, not through lectures and books but through experiences,” writes Sri Swami Rama in the opening pages of this timeless saga. These stories record his personal quest for truth and enlightenment. Inspiring, illuminating, entertaining, mystifying, and frequently droll and humorous, they bring you face-to-face with great Himalayan masters, including:<br />
— Mataji of Assam, a ninety-six-year-old lady sage who never slept<br />
— Gudari Baba, who taught Swami Rama the value of direct experience<br />
— Yogi Sri Aurobindo, who integrated meditation with action<br />
— Uria Baba, who taught that every human being has the potential for healing<br />
— Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation</p>

<p>Karma—the activity of doing and being—is traditionally symbolized as a rope of many strands, holding the human self in the bondage of suffering. In the eight lectures included in this volume, Swami Rama analyzes the mechanisms of karma and the functioning of mind in order to demonstrate the kind of self-study each person must undertake to gain liberation, to attain freedom from the bondage of karma.</p>

<p>In this practical guide to inner life, Swami Rama teaches us how to slip beyond the mental turbulence of our ordinary thought processes into an infinite reservoir of consciousness from which we can draw guidance, creative power, joy, and tranquility.</p>
<p>The Program for Progress in Meditation outlined here opens the door to internal resources we have always had at our disposal, but have not been able to access. These are the techniques the sages of India have used from time immemorial to live in harmony with the world around them, to find strength to face life’s difficulties, and to know themselves.</p>
