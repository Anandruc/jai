										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ian Murphy examines the job of a trader and their relationship with the market—how to survive where so many others have failed. He reveals the habits of serious professionals including essential procedures such as the ‘Eight Checks’ and the ‘Nine Filters’ which should be employed by all traders before a single penny is placed in the market. Most importantly, he explains how the ‘Five Limits of Risk’ allow us to embrace the dangers at the heart of trading, so we can face the market with confidence and clarity.</p>
<p>Using psychology—the key to trading success—we see how the concept of a trading edge is overrated and misunderstood. Buddhist techniques for working with the mind which can be profitably employed in the market have also been discussed here.</p>
<p>The author shares three consistently profitable trading strategies which expose opportunities inherent in the market and demonstrates how to leverage those opportunities. Way of the Trader provides a wealth of practical tools for those who wish to make a living from the markets.</p>
