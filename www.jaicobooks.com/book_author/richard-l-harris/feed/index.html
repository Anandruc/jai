										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to Time magazine, Che Guevara was one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. The revolutionary, anti-Imperialist ideals he lived and died for now appeal to a new generation of 21st-century men and women.</p>
<p>Che Guevara: A Biography provides an introduction to the famous revolutionary leader, and reveals how his early life prepared him for leadership in the Cuban Revolution. It also explores his revolutionary activities in Africa and Bolivia, as well as the circumstances surrounding his tragic death on October 9, 1967.</p>
<p>The book includes original information on the 1997 discovery of the hidden remains of his body and on the celebration of his life and ideals by the socialist regime in Cuba. It also looks at the reasons why leftist political leaders, movements, and governments in Latin America and the Caribbean still pay homage to this charismatic man.</p>
