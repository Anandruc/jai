										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In her first book, In Search of Happiness, author Swati Shiv uses her years of experience as a soul healer and self-empowerment therapist to investigate these questions. The book is an enthralling story of her patient Dev and his severe and confounding mental and emotional conflicts.</p>
<p>Using hypnotherapy, Swati delves deep into Dev’s soul and witnesses his journey over nine lives of crime, violence, illness, fear and harmful attachments. Each session unfolds elements of life between lives, offers time for rest and introspection, and allows his spirit guide to heal the soul and change the belief systems carried over several lifetimes.</p>
<p>The resonating tale of a storm-tossed soul and its journey to a safe harbor, In Search of Happiness is a must-read for anyone who seeks their true self and true expression of that self.</p>
