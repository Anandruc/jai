										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stories to guide you to success</p>
<p>We can resolve most problems by applying the wisdom of our heart; all we have to do is listen carefully. However, in practice, a range of detrimental yet common attributes that we experience in large doses prevent us from listening to our inner voice. In The Code, author Mukta Mahajani identifies these negative attributes as the Ego, Over-Competitiveness, Jealousy, Overexpectations, Overambition, Anger and Procrastination. These attributes flare up when we face challenging situations. We explode when the world does not go our way and our relationships with others suffer as a result.</p>
<p>Based on meaningful quotes from world leaders and revered religious texts, this book weaves short stories about the impact of these attributes. These narratives are designed to help us reset our mindset and resolve the issues we face in our day-to-day life. They help us understand that we have the inherent power to make the right choice at all times.</p>
