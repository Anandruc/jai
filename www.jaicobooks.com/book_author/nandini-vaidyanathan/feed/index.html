										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From your first paying customer to a vibrant user community</p>
<p>Once you have taken the plunge and started your own business, you need to do all the right things to grow it organically. Start Up, Stand Up chalks out the blueprint for the journey from your first paying customer to building a vibrant user community for your products and creating mindshare in them as a go-to brand. Divided into 20 sutras, it is your Bible for all the things you should – and should not! – be doing to grow your company.</p>
<p>This book draws in large measure from the author’s experience of mentoring over 2000 entrepreneurs, spanning a decade and covering 300+ domains. It tells you how you can stand up once you have started up. You will be treated to an enviably rich, variegated and dynamic library of use-cases that depict goof-ups and good practices, misadventures and exhilarating journeys, misdemeanours and text-book fairness, and hubris and humility.</p>
<p>As spirited and informative as a tête-à-tête with the author, and just as effective, Start Up, Stand Up gives you much-needed and valuable insights into how to grow your company successfully.</p>
