<p>IN A Ramshackle workhouse of a parish in England, a baby boy was born to a woman who died in childbirth. The boy was named Oliver Twist. He spent a sad childhood in abject misery in various workhouses. At the age of twelve, he runs away to London where he is picked up by a notorious criminal, Fagin, a mastermind at house breaking, pickpocketing and petty thievery. He teaches Oliver all these evil deeds. But a kind-hearted gentleman robbed by Fagin sympathizes with the plight of Oliver and helps him to find a family, his inheritance and above all Oliver’s true identity.</p>
