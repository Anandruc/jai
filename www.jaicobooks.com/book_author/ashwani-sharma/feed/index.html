										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New enlarged edition</p>
<p>Chanakya was undoubtedly ancient India’s finest political strategist and thinker. But up to this point in time, this political luminary’s views on morality have remained obscure.</p>
<p>Chanakya’s brand of wisdom is ageless and immutable. This volume forcefully impress upon one, the need and the permanence of a moral code. Chanakya expounds his views with amazing foresight and clarity. The book has a large smattering of pithy observations on women, family life, human relationships, moral conduct and spirituality. His startling prophecies, meaningful reflections on everyday living and hardheaded axioms, make this book a rich repository of profundity and reason.</p>
