<p>The best ideas can come from the most unusual and unexpected sources. In this book, leading brand consultant and author Giles Lury presents 75 stories of extraordinary innovation, as well as the many and varied sources of inspiration, that led to companies developing highly successful products and brands.</p>
<p>With tales covering brands including Angry Birds, Diners Club, Fanta, Netflix, Viagra, Spanx and Airbnb, you will find out how one size does not fit all, and that ideas can be sparked by anything and everything—from anger to embarrassment, from people watching to biomimicry (borrowing ideas from the natural world). Ultimately, this book is a call for disruption and deviance, and provides original tips and techniques to help you in your search for the next big thing.</p>
