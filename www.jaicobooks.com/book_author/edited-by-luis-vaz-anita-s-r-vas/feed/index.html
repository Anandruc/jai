										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Full of mischief, valor, ribaldry and romance, The Arabian Nights has enthralled readers for centuries. It tells the much beloved tale of the young bride Scheherazade, who spun enchanting stories to escape death at the hands of her husband, King Shahryar. Scheherazade would begin a new tale each evening but always withhold the ending; a thousand and one nights later, the king found his true love and her life was spared forever.</p>
<p>Magical Tales of the Arabian Nights includes timeless favorites such as Aladdin, Sinbad the Sailor, Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, and even lesser known gems like the whimsical Story of the Three Sisters and the more intricate one of The Three Calendars.</p>
<p>The mystical tales of this collection have long contributed to popular imagination, demonstrating that Scheherazadeâ€™s spell remains unbroken even to this day.</p>
