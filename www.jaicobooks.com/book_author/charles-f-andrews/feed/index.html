										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A passionate portrait of the faith and life of Gandhi, written by one of his closest friends, an Anglican priest. Now with an all-new foreword by Dr. Arun Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi’s grandson, this thoughtful biography offers intriguing insights into Gandhi’s early life, religious practice, and his efforts to further peace and justice in the world.<br />
Written by Charles Andrews – a longtime friend of Gandhi’s – Mahatma Gandhi: His Life &amp; Ideas examines from a contemporary activist’s point of view the religious and political environments that influenced the birth of the peaceful resistance movement, the primary tool that Gandhi and the people of his homeland used to gain India its freedom from British rule.<br />
Including excerpts from Gandhi’s personal correspondence and professional writings, Mahatma Gandhi: His Life &amp; Ideas provides an ideal introduction to the life and life’s work of one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century.<br />
Dr. Arun Gandhi is Mahatma Gandhi’s grandson and cofounder of the M. K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence in Memphis, Tennessee. He is the author of several books, including Legacy of Love: My Education in the Path of Nonviolence.</p>
