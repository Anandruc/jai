										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now in Tamil</p>
<p>For a dozen years as one of the world&#8217;s most admired CEOs, Indra Nooyi redefined what it means to be an exceptional leader. The first woman of color and immigrant to run a Fortune 50 company—and one of the foremost strategic thinkers of our time—she transformed PepsiCo with a unique vision, a vigorous pursuit of excellence, and a deep sense of purpose. Now, in a rich memoir brimming with grace, grit, and good humor, Nooyi offers a first-hand view of her legendary career and the sacrifices it so often demanded.</p>
<p>Nooyi takes us through the events that shaped her, from her childhood and early education in 1960s India, to the Yale School of Management, to her rise as a corporate consultant and strategist who soon ascended into the most senior executive ranks. My Life in Full offers an inside look at PepsiCo, and Nooyi&#8217;s thinking as she steered the iconic American company taoward healthier products and reinvented its environmental profile despite resistance at every turn.</p>
<p>For the first time and in raw detail, Nooyi also lays bare the difficulties that came with managing her demanding job and a growing family, and what she learned along the way. She makes a clear, actionable, urgent call for business and government to prioritize the care ecosystem, paid leave, and work flexibility, and a convincing argument for how improving company and community support for young family builders will unleash the economy&#8217;s full potential.</p>
<p>Generous, authoritative, and grounded in lived experience, My Life in Full is the story of an extraordinary leader&#8217;s life, a moving tribute to the relationships that created it, and a blueprint for twenty-first-century prosperity.</p>
