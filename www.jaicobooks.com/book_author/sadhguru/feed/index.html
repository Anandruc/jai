										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Shiva does not spell religion. Shiva spells responsibility—our ability to take our very life process in our hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>—Sadhguru</p>
<p>&#8216;Shi-va&#8217; is &#8216;that which is not&#8217;, a primordial emptiness; Shiva is also the first-ever yogi, Adiyogi, the one who first perceived this emptiness. Adiyogi is symbol and myth, historic figure and living presence, creator and destroyer, outlaw and ascetic, cosmic dancer and passionate lover, all at once.A book like no other, this extraordinary document is a tribute to Shiva, the Adiyogi, by a living yogi; a chronicle of the progenitor of mysticism by a contemporary mystic. Here science and philosophy merge seamlessly, so do silence and sound, question and answer&#8211;to capture the unspeakable enigma of Adiyogi in a spellbinding wave of words and ideas that will leave one entranced, transformed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year, a group of Isha meditators sets out on a tour of the Himalayas. Accompanying them on this journey is Sadhguru – a spiritual master considered by many to be one of the foremost living yogis on the planet.</p>
<p>This is a book for those who stayed behind. It is a chance to make a pilgrimage on the page, travelling through the unpredictable but fascinating terrain of the master’s words. Amalgamating discourses and conversations from several yatras, it is a blend of the specific and the timeless.</p>
<p>This book is not just about the Himalayas. And yet, the book would never have happened without the Himalayas. The mountains play a vital role in the text, alternately as context and catalyst, mood and metaphor. Without them, some of the questions in this book would never have been asked. Even if they sometimes seem tangential to the line of enquiry, they remain a powerful subterranean presence, eventually becoming the very bedrock of this book.</p>

How many times have each of us wished for answers to life’s deep questions? In Midnights with the Mystic, Cheryl Simone relates her personal experience of learning at the feet of Sadhguru Vasudev, India’s most sought-after mystic.</p>
<p>As we share in her profound experiences, we are challenged to embrace the possibility that to each of us is available a higher realm of reality, a peak of consciousness, an entrée into the realm of freedom and bliss.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The persistent questions of seekers fill this book. It’s all here – the pain, the confusion, the raging gut-level thirst, all that it means to be human and alive and wanting. And through it all are the clear, strong, unwavering tones of a master who reminds us that the only thing that lies between the human and the divine, the finite and the boundless, the seeking and the finding, is choice.</p>
<p>What does that choice entail? Not the acquisition of any path-breaking wisdom, but a determined refusal to strengthen one’s ignorance, to reinforce one’s deceptions, to ‘gold-plate one’s limitations’.</p>
<p>The danger, Sadhguru tells us, does not lie in being in the dark – that can be dispelled for anyone who genuinely desires it – but in settling for an easy brilliance, a spurious radiance. The danger does not lie in seeking urgently, but in arriving cheaply.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For ages, most of humanity has placed “life” and “death” at two ends of the existential spectrum – favoring one, fearing the other and continuously floundering between the two. Only when someone who has consciously traversed between both life and death offers to articulate some aspects of it, does humanity get a glimpse of what lies beyond the horizon of its normal perception.</p>
<p>With his extraordinary insights, coming from a profound inner experience, Sadhguru reveals that life and death are, in fact, two sides of the same coin. It is only by embracing both that we can break the shackles of our self-made struggles and be set free.</p>
<p>In his own words, he says: “Death is a cosmic joke. If you get the joke, when you fall on the other side, it will be wonderful. If you don’t get the joke, when you are here you fear the other side, and when the other side comes, you just don’t know what it is about. If death becomes a laughing matter in your life, life becomes an utterly effortless process – there is no need to restrain yourself in the process of life; you can live your life absolutely, totally.”</p>

<p>Book 1: Mind is your Business</p>
<p>For most people, the mind seems to be an unruly cacophony, attempting to grasp and shape everything which falls in its purview. In mind is your business, Sadhguru explains that only if we make it “our business” to transform this uncoordinated mess into a well – coordinated symphony, will we able to use the mind, rather than be used by it.</p>
<p>Book 2: Body the Greatest Gadget</p>
<p>Body, The Greatest Gadget, is an introduction to the most sophisticated and incredible device on the planet. In the course of this book, Sadhguru explores the yogic physiology and the many subtle dimensions of the body. It is a first step on an intriguing and exciting journey that culminates in total mastery of the system, allowing us to stay rooted in the physical, and yet taste the beyond. Above all, the book is a glimpse of a possibility to live and function in a way that most human beings would consider superhuman.</p>

<p>Joy 24&#215;7 is a very simple but unusual exploration of Joy.</p>
<p>There is no religion in this book. There are no rituals prescribed here. There is no deep meditation being described here and neither is there any mention to any spiritual practice.</p>
<p>This is not a guidebook. This is not a “self-help” book. It is not going to give you “an instant formula for joy”. But it will surely make you explore your Joy for yourself in a very direct way. The simple, short snippets of daily lives connected with what Sadhguru has to say about Joy, will take you on a wonderful roller coaster ride on Joy with the Master himself.</p>
<p>With Sadhguru’s incredible clarity of expression, his brilliant wit and sense of observation, his ability to bring the most profound aspect in a very simple and direct way, this book is for any human being who seeks to be Joyful.</p>
<p>No matter who you are, what you are trying to do, Sadhguru’s words will touch a wonderful wave of Joy inside you and you will soon be restless to seek Joy 24&#215;7.</p>

<p>Emotion: The Juice of Life</p>
<p>“One can make any emotion into a creative force in one’s life.”<br />
– Sadhguru</p>
<p>It’s not just poetic license that allows us to refer to emotions as “juicy”. In a literal sense also, emotions are a chemical cocktail that course through our bodies. But while we have no problems with pleasant emotions, unpleasant emotions are the source of much angst in our lives. In Emotion: The Juice of Life, Sadhguru looks at the gamut of human emotions and how to turn them into stepping stones rather than stumbling blocks.</p>
<p>Relationships Bond or Bondage</p>
<p>“If you enhance yourself into a very beautiful state, everyone will want to hold a relationship with you.”<br />
– Sadhguru</p>
<p>Human beings constantly make and break relationships. Unfortunately, relationships can make and break human beings too. Why are relationships such a circus for most of us? What is this primal urge within us that demands a bond – physical, mental, or emotional – with another? And how do we keep this bond from turning into bondage? These are the fundamental questions that Relationships: Bond or Bondage looks at as Sadhguru shares with us the keys to forming lasting and joyful relationships, whether they are with husband or wife, family and friends, at work, or with the very existence itself.</p>
