										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This compelling narrative paints a delightfully intimate portrait of the Navagrahas. Surya subdues his raging heat to please his beloved Samjna. Chandra lusts after his guru’s wife and is cursed to wane each month. Kuja emerges from a drop of perspiration on Shiva’s brow. Budha marries Ila, who is his wife for one month and a prince in the next. Brhaspati forgives his wife’s adultery and curses an amorous apsara to be born as a monkey. Usana becomes Sukra when he is swallowed by a furious Shiva. Sanaischara requests the Trimurti to ensure he inspire fear in all living beings. Rahu and Ketu wreak their vengeance on Surya and Chandra by swallowing them.</p>
<p>In an irresistible medley of drama, romance, humour and devotion, Navagraha Purana entertains and informs as it asserts that no one is exempt from the implacable influence of the Nine Planets.</p>
