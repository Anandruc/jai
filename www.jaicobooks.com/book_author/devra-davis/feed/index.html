<p>More than five billion cell phones are currently in use, and that number increases every day. Yet, the latest research ties cell phone radiation to lowered sperm counts, an increased risk of Alzheimer’s, and certain types of cancer. What are cell phone companies doing to increase product safety? And how far will they go to protect their interests?</p>
<p>In Disconnect, Devra Davis, a National Book Award finalist, offers a clear and compelling account of the sea change that has taken place in way physicists and biologists think about radiation in the microwave spectrum. Synthesizing the cautionary advice of leading experts in bioelectromagnetics and neuroscience, Davis explains the simple safety measures that we must take – before it’s too late.</p>
