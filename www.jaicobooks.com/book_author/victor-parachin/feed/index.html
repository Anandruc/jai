										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This book presents mindfulness teachings via short insights or meditations. All too often we “forget” to be present. We neglect being mindful when eating, listening, speaking, working, studying, seeing the sunrise and the sunset, being with friends or sipping a cup of tea. As a result, we fail to live our lives to the fullest potential and experience the joy of living. The Buddha, who was the planet’s most prominent practitioner of mindfulness, taught this technique to others.</p>
<p>Think Like the Buddha offers reflections for 108 days of mindfulness. The stories and lessons are brought together to provide insight, information, instruction and inspiration for the reader to cultivate this practice daily. The book is very “user friendly”, immediately applicable regardless of any background in Buddhism, and is thus useful to complete beginners.</p>
<p>The stories and teachings in this book cover a wide variety of specific topics—divorce, illness, losing a job, determining a course of action, etc. All these meditations are infused with the message of compassion that all today are hungering for.</p>
