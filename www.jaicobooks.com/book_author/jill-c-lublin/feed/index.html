										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In order to connect with new clients or future business partners and transform your potential into success, you need to establish trust and build strong relationships. The key is to focus more on giving and working with others rather than simply “winning.” because doing so is guaranteed to help you actually win.</p>
<p>The Profit of Kindness will help you master the art of building trusting, long-lasting relationships through open, nonadversarial interchanges that result in mutually beneficial outcomes. A basic adjustment in attitude and approach can substantially improve virtually every facet of your life. Each chapter provides specific examples for improving skills such as communication, building integrity, team work, influencing others and more. You will learn how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kindness does not mean weakness</li>
<li>Kindness can help you stay competitive, anticipate pitfalls and stay one step ahead of your rivals</li>
<li>Success, achieved through kindness, can indeed be yours</li>
</ul>
