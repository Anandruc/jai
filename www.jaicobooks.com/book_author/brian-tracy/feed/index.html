										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a crisp winter morning, Richard, a successful, self-made CEO runs into Zoya, a quirky, free-spirited artist. The meeting leaves them struggling to find a balance between what they believe about life, and what is actually out there.</p>
<p>What You Seek is Seeking You is a heart-warming tale about what happens when you are forced to question everything you ever knew to be true. Refreshingly honest, it helps you rethink some of your most fundamental beliefs – the ones that hold the very canvas of your life in place, but which in fact may be limiting you.</p>
<p>Setting the scene with a lively fable, Azim &amp; Brian share insightful and tangible ways to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invite Positive Coincidences and Attract What You Seek</li>
<li>Set Goals, Remain Focused and yet Stay Detached from the Outcome</li>
<li>Enhance Your Business Acumen</li>
</ul>

<p>Every great achievement begins with a vision – a dream of something exciting or different. Many Miles to Go combines Brian Tracy’s personal journey of false starts, long days and narrow escapes with lessons on how to become unstoppable in his personal and professional life.</p>
<p>The aim of this book is simple: project forward five years and imagine that your life is now perfect in every way. What does it look like? What are you doing? Who is there with you? This book teaches you that once you’ve decided where you’re going, the only question you have to ask yourself is “How do I get there?”</p>

<p>We may feel stuck and unable to take certain items off our “To Do” lists for one simple reason: the timing isn’t right. In Master Your Time, Master Your Life, international speaker, productivity expert and bestselling author Brian Tracy explains why tackling the right project at the right time is of the utmost importance. By using our time in the appropriate way in the most important areas of our lives we will accomplish much more, faster and more easily than we ever thought possible!</p>
<p>Based on the most recent research in the field of productivity, as well as the author’s personal experiences and those of his clients, Tracy’s method involves identifying the ten different “times” in which we operate and the unique approach required for each of these in order to perform at our very best.</p>
<p>Master Your Time, Master Your Life provides simple steps we can use to figure out when we will be most productive for a specific task and when we should move on to the next item on our list, outlining a framework for optimal productivity that will change lives forever!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scores of books, articles, blog posts and videos have been created around it. But somehow there still seems to be a confusion regarding wealth creation. There is so much of “white noise” around this subject that most people either rely on chance for their fortunes or ignore the topic all together.</p>
<p>The Science of Money is an attempt to dispel all myths related to the topic of making money and making it last. According to authors Brian Tracy and Dan Strutzel, there is a science of money just as there is science of medicine, engineering, nutrition and the likes.</p>
<p>This book ends all confusion once and for all, and presents in one comprehensive program the essential truths about money. If you simply study the ideas in this program and apply them to your life and your business, you will become financially successful – as sure as tomorrow’s sunrise.</p>

<p>The idea of being successful is an attractive dream that fills us with positive emotions, whereas the actions required to get ahead of the game at work, in relationships, in sports, or in any other area are often difficult and lengthy.</p>
<p>What do we need to do to close this gap between what we want and what we have to do to achieve it? We need goal-oriented motivation. This is the fuel that takes us across the long and often uncertain bridge to our desired destination in life.</p>
<p>The trick is to learn how to develop this kind of motivation on demand, sustain it through the difficult periods, and instill it so intricately into our daily life that it becomes a part of us.</p>
<p>All of that and more is available in this all-new cutting-edge book, The Science of Motivation, from personal development expert Brian Tracy and his co-author Dan Strutzel.</p>

<p>The trick is to learn how to develop this kind of motivation on demand, sustain it through the difficult periods, and instill it so intricately into our daily life that it becomes a part of us.</p>
<p>All of that and more is available in this all-new cutting-edge book, The Science of Motivation, from personal development expert Brian Tracy and his co-author Dan Strutzel.</p>
