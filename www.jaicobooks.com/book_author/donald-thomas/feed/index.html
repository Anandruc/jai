										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, the indefatigable detective, and his assistant Dr. Watson, will track down the perpetrators through the occult underworld of Victorian London.</p>
<p>Next, on the eve of World War I, he is confronted with fraud and forgery at the Royal Navy Academy in The Case of a Boy‘s Honor. Back in London, behind the scenes of the Herculaneum Theatre in the Strand, The Case of the Matinee Idol embroils Holmes and Watson directly in an apparent on-stage murder. How did poison get into two Shakespearean goblets when only the victim, now dead, had access to them and the most likely suspect was a mile away with an unbreakable alibi?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But not for Sherlock Holmes, who, in a stunning display of intellect and derring-do, will elude his hangman’s noose and live to fiddle, spy and ratiocinate another day.</p>
<p>Against tremendous odds, Holmes will continue to defy his enemies in four more encounters, from cracking German intelligence codes, to going against Scotland Yard and the Crown in proving the innocence of a man condemned to death for the slaying of a pregnant serving girl, to an arsenic-wielding magician, and of course, to a battle of wits with the malevolent Moriarty. Everywhere in these five finely-wrought tales, riddles and mystery hover in the air. But they are not beyond the grasp of the incomparable Holmes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Accompanied as ever by Dr. Watson, Holmes here investigates: The alleged bigamy of King George V&#8230; The theft of the Irish Crown Jewels in 1907&#8230; The bizarre circumstances of the death of President Faure of France&#8230; Such dramas are not fiction but historical reality.</p>
<p>The investigations described in this volume relate the part played by the great detective in seven major crimes or scandals of the day, some of them too damaging to the monarchy, the government or the security of the nation to be fully revealed at the time.</p>
<p>Compiled in narrative form by Dr. Watson soon after the great detective’s death, Holmes’s notes have been kept under lock and key at the Public Record Office in Chancery Lane.</p>
<p>Now, seventy years later, we can finally open the secret casebook of Sherlock Holmes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again the game is afoot, in these highly original stories featuring Sherlock Holmes at the height of his powers. Crossing historical fact with inventive fiction, the master of pastiche Donald Thomas plunges Holmes into London’s Siege of Sidney Street, where he ratiocinates alongside Winston Churchill in obstructing an anarchist’s assassination plot led by ‘Peter the Painter.’ In the next adventure, Holmes and Watson are confounded by the Riddle of the Zimmerman Telegram during World War I, as Holmes must employ all his wits to defeat a plan for a German-led invasion of the United States. In other mystifying tales of detection, Sherlock Holmes searches for the treasures of King John, lost in 1216. Foiling a foul extortion attempt, Holmes and Watson aid in discovering Lord Byron’s epic poem evoking his secret journey to Virginia. Finally the great detective, in a bravura performance, confronts a supernatural curse in “Lord Arthur Savile’s Crime.”</p>
