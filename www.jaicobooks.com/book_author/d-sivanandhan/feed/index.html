										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chanakya, who lived in India in the 4th Century BC, was a leadership guru par excellence. The treasure of his teachings can be found in his book, The Arthashastra, which deals with good governance based on ideal leadership.</p>
<p>The concept of the ideal nation in The Arthashastra, called Saptanga, holds that there are seven pillars of a kingdom: Swami, Amatya, Janpada, Durg, Kosha, Dand, Mitra iti Prakritya. For centuries, Indian rulers have used this concept as a model of successful government.</p>
<p>In this path-breaking book, Chanakya’s 7 Secrets of Leadership, author Radhakrishnan Pillai delves into Chanakya’s Saptanga with the real-life example of D. Sivanandhan. Former Director General of Police, Maharashtra, and the archetype of an able administrator, Sivanandhan shares his guidelines for effective management, highlighting those that make him a dynamic leader.</p>
<p>In Chanakya’s 7 Secrets of Leadership, theory meets practice, academic research meets vast experience in police supervision and an age-old formula is revealed in a modern-day success story. Together, Pillai and Sivanandhan bring Chanakya’s model to life.</p>
<p>Anyone can use the seven secrets of leadership to run a kingdom effectively. Apply them in your life, and the magic of Chanakya’s wisdom will transform you into the ideal leader.</p>
