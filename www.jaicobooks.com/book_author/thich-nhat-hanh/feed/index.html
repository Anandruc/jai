										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this extraordinary celebration of spirituality The Energy Of Prayer demonstrates the relevance of prayer in our daily lives. Thich Nhat Hanh reveals how the energies of prayer and meditation allow us to reconnect with our higher selves while satisfying our basic need to connect with the world as a whole. With a generous spirit that acknowledges the many different types and functions of prayer, The Energy Of Prayer provides a guide for deepening our spiritual practice through the use of prayer.</p>
<p>Thich Nhat Hanh introduces the reader to several meditation methods that re-envision prayer as an open, inclusive, and accessible practice that helps create healthy lives through the power of awareness and intention. This book includes visualization and breathing exercises, as well as a rich sampling of prayers, chants, and invocations from the Buddhist tradition.</p>
