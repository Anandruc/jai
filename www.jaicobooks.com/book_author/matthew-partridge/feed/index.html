<p>There has never been a better time to be an ordinary investor. With more opportunities, lower costs and a more level playing field than ever before, you really can go head to head with the professionals. But there remains one big difference between Wall Street and the individual investor: technique and experience.</p>
<p>Superinvestors provides both in a new way. It takes an in-depth look at 20 of the best investors in the last 200 years and shows the reader how to adopt a similar approach. These investors have been picked for a variety of criteria, including their investing excellence, the different ways in which they made money and, above all, for what they can teach individual investors.</p>
<p>Ranging from David Ricardo, who made a fortune by correctly predicting the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo, to the patient, value-orientated approach of Warren Buffett, this book a treasure trove of success stories, cautionary tales, legendary stock picks and world-beating strategies. It will fascinate and inspire investors of every level.</p>
