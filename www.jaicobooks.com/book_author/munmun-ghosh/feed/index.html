										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A novel</p>
<p>The poignant tale of a husband and wife who fight adversities to keep their marriage going.</p>
<p>Young and beautiful Mayuri, wife of affluent businessman Vimal, is crushed as she fails to conceive even with medication. Deeply in love with his wife, Vimal gives in to her plea to seek help through reproductive technology. The treatments tax the couple physically and emotionally, straining their relations.</p>
<p>While Vimal grapples with his business challenges, Mayuri plods along, restless, depressed, painfully aware of her growing age and convinced she cannot be content unless she has a child. In her desperation, she turns to religion and even hurtles to the edge of infidelity.</p>
<p>What makes a coupleâ€™s life complete?<br />
Are children the indispensable glue binding a family?<br />
And does motherhood and fatherhood have to be biological?</p>
