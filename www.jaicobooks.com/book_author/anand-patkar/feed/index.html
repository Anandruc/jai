										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No matter who you are or what your background is, you are worthy of a content and fruitful life. All you need to do is be aware of the manipulations of your mind. Human mind can be a powerful tool if you know how to use it.</p>
<p>With the help of many real-life examples and anecdotes, bestselling author Anand Patkar delves into the intricacies of human mind to illustrate that contrary to popular belief it is possible to rewire your mind to make it work for you.</p>
<p>Patkar equates one’s chaotic state of mind to a monkey to explain the havoc it can cause if left unchecked. In the same way, he compares the inborn wisdom we all possess to “Moorti Within”,<br />
a God-like quality that unfortunately gets eclipsed when a person is in the grip of a cocktail of emotions.</p>
<p>So who’s really in charge of your life? Monkey or Moorti?</p>
<p>Read on to know how to regain control of your supreme consciousness to lead a life full of peace and happiness each day.</p>
