										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether it is procuring Nazi secrets during World War II, trying to assassinate Fidel Castro in the peak of Cold War, attempting to overthrow the Iranian government in 1953 to protect the interests of American and British oil companies or capturing and killing of Osama bin Laden following 9/11, the part played by the CIA and other American spy agencies in all these operations have been more overt than covert. Apart from keeping America safe, these agencies play an important role in keeping peace between countries, making the Unites States the Big Brother. Working together, American intelligence agencies are today helping the U.S. battle terrorism and other threats in 130 countries on 6 different continents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Only hours after the nation of Israel was established on May 14, 1948, five neighboring Arab nations attacked, hoping to wipe out the new country. The attackers had far more soldiers and weapons than Israel but underestimated how much information Israeli spies had already gathered about the Arab nations’ military capabilities and strategies. The war quickly turned in Israel’s favor. Israel’s survival from 1948 to today has depended on its maintaining a well-established intelligence network to gather secret data, carry out covert operations, and counter terrorism. At the heart of this network is the Mossad, a shadowy organization charged with keeping Israel safe from outside enemies by any means necessary.</p>
<p>Read all about Israel’s formidable spy network and their espionage missions around the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even in peaceful times, spies need to use both modern espionage tools and old-fashioned spying techniques to uncover or protect state secrets. Modern spies face diverse situations including discovering animals with embedded chips to monitor activity in enemy territory or go through intercepted communications such as e-mails, voice messages and telephone conversations. Although there have been several technological developments in spying tools available, they come with their own limitations like drone weapons being unable to distinguish between terrorists and peaceful civilians. Take a peek into the world of corporate espionage in organizations zealously protecting their trade secrets through cases such as Proctor &amp; Gamble spying on Unilever to stay ahead of competition.</p>
<p>Unravel international secrets from covert operations such as the search for and killing of Osama bin Laden by American special forces in this book.</p>

Officers of the Oprichnina dressed all in black and rode black horses. They terrorized the Russian people, killing thousands whom they blamed for made-up acts of treason. Many rulers after Ivan also created their own security forces to spy on Russians at home or living outside the country. The Russian security forces of the 20th and 21st centuries—known at different times as the Cheka, NKVD, KGB, and SVR—have added to a long tradition of power, fear, and secrecy that began more than 400 years ago.</p>
