										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world around us can be a catalyst for creative inspiration anytime, anywhere, if we know how to see it that way. Learn to connect with your own genius more deeply and shift into new ways of seeing, and fold this ability to wonder and engage curiosity into your everyday life.</p>
<p>Eliza Lay Ryan teaches us how to cultivate supermindfulness, giving us greater access to the ability to be both present to our own experience, and open to new ways of thinking, feeling, and being so we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respond dynamically and authentically to life</li>
<li>Shift our perspective</li>
<li>Access our wholeness more fully</li>
<li>Connect with each other more wholly</li>
</ul>
