										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“For so long you have worshipped me, sat in my temple, offered prayers, asked for answers to your questions. Yet I stand before you, and you do not recognise me? Look with your heart, Rajendra: I am Devi, whom you worship as Katyayani, as Parvati, and as Durga.”</p>
<p>She held her arms open, smiling at Raj. “Now do you see?”</p>
<p>Raj, a cloth merchant’s son from Delhi, lives a contemplative life in the old town of Sultanpur. He seeks meaning in his rapidly advancing nation but feels that India’s beauty is locked in the past and forgotten by the consistent desire to imitate the West.</p>
<p>Guided by his wise grandfather, Raj sets out to explore the source of all things spiritual, cultural and poetic – and in a series of spellbinding visions from gods and goddesses, his destiny unfolds. As he learns to be the guardian of the millions of souls who take birth in this land, he must ensure they have a truly spiritual place to call home. And so he comes face to face with the last true evil that roams the earth, the enemy of the world, and the one who has brought emperors to their knees: Kali!</p>
<p>Of Noble Blood is an enthralling medley of drama, fantasy and history, celebrating the possibilities of glorious, timeless India.</p>
