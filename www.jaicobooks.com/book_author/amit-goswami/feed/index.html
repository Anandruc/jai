										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At last, science and the soul shake hands. Writing in a style that is both lucid and charming, mischievous and profound, Dr. Amit Goswami uses the language and concepts of quantum physics to explore and scientifically prove metaphysical theories of reincarnation and immortality.</p>
<p>Dr. Goswami helps you understand the mysteries of the quantum physics model of reality and the long-held beliefs of spiritual and religious traditions. They are not only compatible but also provide essential support for each other. The result is a deeply enriched worldview that integrates mind and spirit into science. Consciousness, not materiality, is the primary reality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Quantum physics is the key to understanding consciousness, life, death, God, psychology, and the meaning of life. It is an antidote to the moral sterility and mechanistic approach of scientific materialism and is the clearest approach to understanding our universe. In short, quantum physics is indeed the theory of everything.</p>
<p>Goswami and his friends and colleagues discuss how quantum physics affects our understanding of Zen thoughts, feelings, and intuitions, dreams and their meaning, quantum reincarnation, and the spiritualization of economics and business, politics and education, and society itself.</p>
<p>The Everything Answer Book has a wealth of information for those interested in the new physics to those captivated by the spiritual implications of the latest scientific breakthroughs.</p>
