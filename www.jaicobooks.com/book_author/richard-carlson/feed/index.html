										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now in Hindi</p>
<p>Foreword by Wayne Dyer</p>
<p>Most of us believe that our happiness depends on external, unavoidable circumstances and that by solving our problems, improving our relationships or achieving success, we will find contentment.</p>
<p>But with You Can Be Happy No Matter What, you will understand how to be happy before having to solve any problems. In a profound breakthrough in human psychology, the book outlines four key principles and explores their impact on your relationships, stress, addictions and state-of-mind. It shows you that happiness has nothing to do with forces beyond your control â€“ in fact, as Dr. Carlson says, it is your natural state.</p>
