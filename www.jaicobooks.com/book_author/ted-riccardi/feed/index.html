										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sherlock Holmes is dead – or so most of the world thinks. His fatal plunge over the Reichenbach Falls as he struggled with his archenemy, Moriarty, has been widely reported.</p>
<p>But Holmes has escaped and is alive.</p>
<p>From 1891 to 1894, Holmes wanders through Asia. He is alone, without Watson, without Scotland Yard, armed only with his physical strength and his revered cold logic and rationality. The adventures recounted in The Lost Years of Sherlock Holmes range from Lhasa to Katmandu, from the East Indies to the deserts of Rajasthan. He confronts the tsarist agent Dorjiloff, the great art thief Anton Furer, and the mysterious Captain Fantôme. For Holmes’s fans throughout the world, the stories in The Lost Years of Sherlock Holmes fill an enigmatic missing chapter in the great detective’s career.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a thrilling jaunt in the Far East, Holmes and Watson return to England to address an inheritance left by one of Watson’s relatives in Cornwall, half of which is entrusted to Sherlock Holmes.</p>
<p>Financially secure, the two are now free to spend as much time on Baker Street and the Continent as they please, and the duo find themselves as comfortable in Rome on the banks of the Tiber as they do on the Thames. As Holmes rationalizes and ratiocinates his way through adventure after adventure, from The Case of Two Bohemes to A Singular Event in Tranquebar, it is all in a day’s work, until clues surface that his great nemesis, Professor James Moriarty, might still be alive . . .</p>
<p>“There’s no way to dance around it: Ted Riccardi’s work is absolutely brilliant. It is as if he is channeling Conan Doyle. Once you’re a few pages into these stories, you would swear that these were newly discovered manuscripts, unearthed by Conan Doyle’s estate. Or, better yet, I had the feeling that I had stumbled upon some pulp magazines where Conan Doyle was still writing. Riccardi has it all down – the cadence, the language, everything. He doesn’t try to subtly update Holmes for the modern audience, either. It is as if each and every tale was written at the turn of the century, and not the twenty-first.”</p>
