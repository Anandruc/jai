										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The stories of ordinary women who went on to become extraordinary</p>
<p>Breaking Barriers is a book chronicling the lives of some prominent Indian women entrepreneurs, who have followed their dreams and fulfilled their ambitions. They refused to succumb to the pressures and established norms that society insists on imposing on women. This book has been written to encourage girls and women (and indeed anyone who aspires to do anything out of the ordinary) to know that they are the sole arbiters of their lives. They have the Power.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Business the Kishore Biyani Way explores this stellar entrepreneur’s leadership traits and unique qualities that led over seemingly insurmountable obstacles and set up his sprawling empire.</p>
<p>Influential leaders have the vision, farsightedness, persistence and conviction to take that one step forward and make a giant leap of a difference.</p>
<p>What makes Biyani’s story unique is that he understood and caught on to the aspirations of Indians at the time of slow-moving economic liberalization. He created and encouraged consumption and made people realize that the desire to buy for sheer pleasure was not bad.</p>
<p>Biyani does not fit into any archetypal model of leadership – he is reserved, dresses inconspicuously, is self-effacing and not in the habit of making glib presentations. However, he has a definite vision; he understands retail and consumption and he knows what people want. Most of all, he displays the all-important quality of persistence to see his ideas through.</p>
