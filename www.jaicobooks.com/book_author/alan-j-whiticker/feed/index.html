										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SPEECHES THAT CHANGED THE WORLD covers speeches about power and equality. These include recurring themes such as politics and diplomacy, war and peace, freedom and justice, civil rights and human rights.

Josef Stalin and Mahatma Gandhi speak side by side with Nelson Mandela, Joseph McCarthy, the Kennedy brothers and Fidel Castro. Speeches by George W. Bush and Arundhati Roy show conflicting views of our modern world.</p>
