										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Canada’s Naked News lead anchor chose the stage name “Victoria Sinclair” to debut her risqué take on global headlines, little did she know that millions of viewers would soon tune in to watch her artfully disrobe in front of the camera. But behind every alter ego is a real person, often hidden from public view, and there’s much that “Victoria” is hiding. . . .</p>
<p>Raised in a family of artists and intellectuals, the young Victoria-to-be excelled in school – as well as in the tutorials of her exotic grandmother. But her real education comes in high school, compliments of a handsome, talented scrapper named Paul who gives her his heart, body and soul – only to be devastated when he loses the girl he’s crazy about to dreams and ambitions too big for their small Canadian town. Those ambitions are realized in Toronto as she climbs the corporate ladder – and falls under the seductive spell of an older, worldly man who orchestrates her transformation from a shy brainiac in a business suit into a sensual siren named Victoria Sinclair.</p>
<p>With a come-hither voice and seemingly nothing to lose but her clothes, Victoria isn’t as easy in her own skin as a growing legion of fans believe her to be. Victoria’s got a secret – actually a few. So when a twist of fate brings Paul back into her life, will he even recognize the girl she once was?</p>
<p>Will she?</p>
