										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authentic narration of the epic with life lessons</p>
<p>A good game is full of twists and turns at every stage and this magical epic arms us with valuable tools to deal with anomalies in our own lives. These quirks turn us into valiant warriors in the face of the most challenging situations. Each one of us falls into three categories in this game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive contributor. The sages headed by the iconic Vishwamitra strive to contribute positively to society.</li>
<li>Negative destroyer. Demons headed by Maricha and Subahu try to cast spells of intense negativity.</li>
<li>Protective meditator. Rama and Lakshmana work hard to protect the positive from corrupting influences.</li>
</ul>
<p>So which role do you want to play in this game?</p>
<p>Roar with Courage is the first book in Ramayana: The Game of Life series. A modern retelling of the Bala Kanda of Valmiki’s epic, it presents the realities of life with far-reaching and thought-provoking lessons. With deep wisdom, author Shubha Vilas explains the timeless values that will be relevant to the contemporary world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authentic narration of the epic with life lessons</p>
<p>Life should be predictable and smooth — this is what most of us are comfortable with. In reality, we face stress, hard times and unexpected upheavals that can knock our breath out.</p>
<p>Every situation in the Ramayana is a reflection of our modern dilemmas, and teaches us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Face challenges positively. The enigmatic Rama is unwavering in his many acts of valour.</li>
<li>Deal with temptation. A judicious Bharata’s decisions and subsequent help in making decisions.</li>
<li>Step out of the comfort zone. Resolute in her faith, Sita is an inspiration to anyone willing to explore beyond their usual confines.</li>
</ul>
<p>How do we cope with a sudden turn of events without losing hope?</p>
<p>Conquer Change is the second book in Ramayana: The Game of Life series. A modern retelling of the Ayodhya Kanda of Valmiki’s epic, the book is all about facing the reversal of fortune and moving on. Author Shubha Vilas reveals profound rules of human relationships and conduct – what works, what fails to work and how to navigate through this amazing labyrinth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authentic narration of the epic with life lessons</p>
<p>Feeling frustrated over events that are out of our control is a waste of energy and time. Rama and his army survived the grim years of exile by being patient and persistent, trusting each other with their lives. The characters’ determination reflects our own set of values and judgment during challenging situations and how we must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut through the chaos. Rama’s righteousness helped him stay his course, undeterred.</li>
<li>Adhere to your principles. Laxman’s loyalty ensured that he remained where he needed to be for good to triumph over evil.</li>
<li>Remain calm in the face of adversity. Sita’s resilience allowed her to endure her terrible predicament.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have the patience to stick with your goals till the end?</p>
<p>Adopt Patience is the third book in Ramayana: The Game of Life series. A modern retelling of the Aranya Kanda of Valmiki’s epic, this volume explores the dynamics of the complex games of power and greed, mirroring our own dilemmas in the modern world, and prompts us to overcome them using the wisdom spilled over these pages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authentic narration of the epic with life lessons</p>
<p>Life is a constant reminder that nothing, however powerful in one season, remains so in the next. These endless cycles of change could really spook someone who is unprepared to face the realities. Remember that situations of helplessness are always created by one’s own limited imagination.</p>
<ul>
<li>Perception appears larger than reality. Many were afraid to battle the Lankans, but grounded in reality, Rama and his army managed to free Sita.</li>
<li>Fear results in pain. Lying broken and bruised, Sampati did not believe he could help until he did and it made all the difference.</li>
<li>Clarity leads to freedom. Rama never wavered in his single-minded pursuit, and eventually got exactly what he wanted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have the courage to face your fears?</p>
<p>Stand Strong is the fourth book in Ramayana: The Game of Life series. A modern retelling of the Kishkindha Kanda of Valmiki’s epic, it reminds us through the tragic story of brothers Vali and Sugriva that life is like a dangerous treasure hunt. One must be resilient while running through confusing, zigzagging paths to acquire essential wisdom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How one expands one’s scope of action with confidence and calm under extremely challenging circumstances is what separates the extraordinary from the ordinary, just like Hanuman did. His selfless determination to stay the course with steadfast focus and faith to accomplish his mission makes him a worthy and inspiring protagonist. Here are some invaluable lessons from his life on overcoming obstacles:</p>
<p>Be confident. With unwavering faith in himself, Hanuman jumped across the ocean to find Sita in an unfamiliar land.</p>
<p>Say no to distractions. Absolute focus helped him prioritize his course of action.</p>
<p>Know your rivals. Competing with Surasa would be futile, so he realized that it was wiser to take on a humbler approach.</p>
<p>Are you confident and fearless enough to achieve your goals?</p>
<p>Radiate Confidence is the fifth book in Ramayana: The Game of Life series. A modern retelling of the Sundara Kanda of Valmiki’s epic, this book highlights Hanuman’s devotion and heroics. Replete with lessons on faithfulness, loyalty, self-confidence, self-belief, fearlessness and all the attributes that help counter challenges and find success, the author, Shubha Vilas, illuminates the path to success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How one responds to difficult situations when faced with challenges determines the outcome. The ability of Rama’s army of vanaras to envision building the bridge from the mainland to Lanka to rescue Sita is one of the many lessons on faith. Here are some invaluable lessons on overcoming obstacles.</p>
<p>Think big. The tiny squirrels contributed in their small ways to build the mammoth bridge to Lanka.</p>
<p>Aim high. Sugriva, leading a vanara army, dared to win a war without any armor or training against a sophisticated demon army.</p>
<p>Recognise opportunities and adapt. Hanuman could expand his size or contract, focusing on his goal to serve Rama.</p>
<p>Are you thinking big to succeed in life?</p>
<p>Think big to win is the sixth book in Ramayana: The Game of Life series. A modern retelling of the Yuddha Kanda of Valmiki’s epic, this book highlights the efforts of the various characters who irrespective of their size, stature or abilities, succeeded in helping Rama rescue Sita from Lanka. Teeming with lessons in self-belief and daring to take up tasks which may seem beyond your capacity and accomplishing them, the book evokes progressive attitudes to help you overcome self-perceived limitations and achieve your dreams.</p>
