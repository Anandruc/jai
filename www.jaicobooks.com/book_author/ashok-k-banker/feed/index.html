										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First in Ashok Banker’s The Epic Mahabharata series, The Children of Midnight explores the home of the illustrious Kuru dynasty, which has just welcomed two new sons – Dritarashtra and Pandu. Cursed with unfortunate afflictions from the moment they are born, the two nevertheless grow up to be skillful young princes. As the wicked Jarasandha plots to seize their empire, they must prove their mettle and fight for their lives – and their legacy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in distant Bhoja, a young Kunti sacrifices her youth – and her heart – to appease the wrath of Sage Durvasa. And his reward for her service inextricably links her fate with that of the entire Kurujangala.</p>
<p>Delving into the youthful lives of the forerunners of the powerful Pandava and Kaurava dynasties, India’s epic storyteller is back with a magically woven and beautifully narrated series that is just as gripping as the ones before it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But the threat of the demon Jarasandha still looms large. And this time, it is Pandu who must face his wrath. Ashok Banker is back with an enchanting new tale, flawlessly fusing history to magic in The Darkness Before Dawn, the second in the Mahabharata series.</p>
<p>Kunti, now married to Pandu, contemplates her future, still unable to come to terms with her decisions of the past. Overcome with remorse, she seeks solace in the holy waters of the Ganga never guessing that the son she gave up was even then causing a stir in her own kingdom.</p>
<p>Oblivious to the mischief afoot in Hastinapur, Pandu is on a mission to purge Rajagriha of the devil’s presence. But even with his prodigious skills in battle, will he be able to fell the mad king Driddha? Or will the ghosts of his past stop him?</p>
