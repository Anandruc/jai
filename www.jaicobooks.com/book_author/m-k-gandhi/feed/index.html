										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My Experiments With Truth – the autobiography of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (or Mahatma Gandhi) covers his life from early childhood through to 1920, and is a popular and influential book. It was initiated at the insistence of Swami Anand and other close co-workers of Gandhi, in his mother-tongue Gujarati entitled Satyana Prayogo athva Atmakatha.</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948) was a charismatic leader who brought the case for India’s independence to world attention. His philosophy of nonviolence, for which he coined the term satyagraha, has influenced nonviolent resistance movements to this day. For Gandhi, Truth was the sovereign principle; inclusive of many other spiritual principles and schools of thought.</p>
<p>In this autobiography, Gandhi has recounted the period from his birth (1869) up to the year 1921. In the last chapter, he notes, “My life from this point onward has been so public that there is hardly anything about it that people do not know&#8230;”</p>
