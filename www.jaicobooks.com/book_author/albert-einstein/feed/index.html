<p>Albert Einstein–the father of modern physics proposed the theory of relativity. Even today, scientists find evidence supporting his theories while conducting research with advanced equipment.</p>
<p>He wrote this book “to give an exact insight into the theory of relativity to those readers who, from a general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics.”</p>
<p>While the theory of relativity enriched astronomy and physics during the 20th century, technology today is getting ahead because of Einstein. Relativity: The Special and the General Theory caters to those interested in understanding the conceptual basics of scientific and technological advancements that Einstein proposed, in simple terms.</p>
