										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China remains one of the hottest business environments in the world, with the country’s unexpected and sustained growth rate continuing even in these tumultuous economic times. Many corporations and countless entrepreneurs are looking to capitalize on this, but often with a limited understanding not just of Chinese business, but of Chinese businesspeople and how they think.</p>
<p>Inside the Chinese Business Mind: A Tactical Guide for Managers focuses on helping business leaders and managers get an understanding of the core values and beliefs that drive business in China. It is a perfect tool for helping business people gain insights into the vastly different, surprisingly diverse Chinese business culture. The book also provides profound learning for leaders and their values and behaviors in the process.</p>
<p>At the core of Inside the Chinese Business Mind is an in-depth study which gathered responses from over 200 business leaders. Going beyond the scope of traditional guidebooks, the study incorporates elements of psychology, philosophy, and business, resulting in a fascinating portrait of the Chinese people, one that finds clear distinctions in behaviors and priorities across different regions, among various age groups, and within other demographic categories. The specific information will help business leaders develop the kind of cultural awareness that leads to greater opportunities and stronger relationships in China, at home, and within themselves.</p>
