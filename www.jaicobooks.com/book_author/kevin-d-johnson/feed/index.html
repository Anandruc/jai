										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Achieve unimaginable business success and financial wealth. Reach the upper echelons of entrepreneurs, where you’ll find Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Sara Blakely of Spanx, Mark Pincus of Zynga and many others.</p>
<p>Develop the Entrepreneur Mind – a way of thinking that comes from learning the vital lessons of the best entrepreneurs. Through compelling stories of modern-day business tycoons, Kevin Johnson, president of the multi-million dollar company Johnson Media Inc., shares the essential beliefs, characteristics and habits of elite entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>In this riveting book, written for new and veteran entrepreneurs, Johnson identifies 100 lessons in seven key areas: Strategy, Education, People, Finance, Marketing and Sales, Leadership, and Motivation. Lessons include how to think big, who makes the best business partners, what captivates investors, when to abandon a business idea, where to avoid opening a business bank account, and why too much formal education can hinder your entrepreneurial growth.</p>
<p>Smart and insightful, The Entrepreneur Mind is the ultimate primer on how to think like an entrepreneur.</p>
