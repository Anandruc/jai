										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A person can transform into an icon if he develops a collection of admirable attitudes over a period of time. Taking the great Swami Vivekananda as the role model, The Vivekananda Way presents attitudes in seven opposing pairs that can be adopted to radically change our lives and make us all icons in our chosen fields. These attitudes are paired specifically to help expand our inner and outer worlds and achieve a true balance between them.</p>
<p>The author, ARK Sarma, emphasizes the difference between ‘vision’ and ‘seeing the big picture’ and shows the way forward to developing the traits that shape a great personality.</p>
<p>Replete with over 108 life incidences and teachings of the great spiritual leader, this book will propel anyone to become an outstanding human being and achieve overall success.</p>
