										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sex is never an easy subject to talk about. And that, perhaps, is why most people know so little about it. LET’S TALK about GUYS, GIRLS and SEX takes a light-hearted yet illuminating stance and starts a very important dailogue.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">The journey from teenage to adulthood is often the most daunting. And to make it even more complicated, there is heaps of seldom-verifiable information online. Can you catch AIDS by having lunch with a HIV positive friend? What is an erection? Is this love or just lust? What are the different contraceptives available in the market? How does one get pregnant?</span></p>
<p>Targeted at young adults and their parents, each chapter starts with a story that makes the topic easy to relate to. Author Swati Shome uses her years of experience with young adults to open the channels of communication. Everything you need to know about the mystery that surrounds sex lies within these pages.</p>
<p>So come on&#8230; Let’s talk!</p>
