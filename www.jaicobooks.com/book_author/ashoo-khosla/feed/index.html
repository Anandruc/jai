										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Too often, being innovative and original is considered the forte of a select few. But all of us are born creative. We are born curious. It is the fear of doing something different – and failing at it – that limits our potential.</p>
<p>Aditi Singh is a top-notch product manager. Many covet her job but she wants nothing more than to quit. When she finally takes a much-needed vacation from her seemingly perfect corporate life, she meets Dr. Shiv Prakash, an odd little man who is a master storyteller.</p>
<p>Through his unusual imaginings, he challenges Aditi to find her true passion. As they spend more time together, Aditi uncannily begins to relate to the characters of his stories. Questions are raised and challenges are set. This time, Aditi has to decide what she really wants. Running away is no more an option. It’s time to write her own story.</p>
<p>Through its charming characters, Off the Corporate Bus and Into the Creativity Boat offers a glimpse of what you can truly be. It invites you to pursue your passion and strive for true happiness, all while being unique.</p>
