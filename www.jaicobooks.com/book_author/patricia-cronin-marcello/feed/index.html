										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This new, up-to-date biography provides insight into the curious and winning personality of the Dalai Lama as a boy and his wisdom as a man. His story is revealed from early family life to his experiences in the world, his education as the 14th incarnation of the Lama, his exile in India, and his current struggles to help Tibet regain its independence from China. Especially helpful is the historical overview of the Tibetan crisis after the Chinese invasion.</p>
<p>A timeline and glossary supplement the text. Though the book is written especially for high school students, it will also immensely interest general readers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mohandas K. Gandhi, known as Mahatma (‘great soul’) Gandhi, is revered worldwide for his non violent action in freeing India from British rule. Discover his journey from family and home in the provinces to an early arranged marriage, his solo sojourn in England towards a career in law, and his transformation from a timid barrister in South Africa to India’s foremost negotiator with the British power structure.</p>
<p>The narrative also illuminates Indian society and the caste system from the latter half of the 19th century up to World War II, covering British colonial rule, racism in South Africa and India, and Hinduism. We also glimpse the controversial aspects of Gandhi’s choices. How he was largely an absentee husband and father. How, after siring four children, he took a vow of celibacy, yet formed attachments to several young, female Western devotees through the years. And how, ultimately, it was his role as a compromiser who believed in Hindus and Muslims in a free, united India that led to his assassination.</p>
