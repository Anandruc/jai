										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you are a student, a businessman, an entrepreneur, or a teacher, you will glean much information from the shared material in this volume. By using the shared secrets uncovered during his lifetime of research and practice, Napoleon Hill guides you step-by- step in becoming the person you were meant to be.</p>
<p>There are 52 chapters – that equates to one per week. Read a little, reflect a lot, and then when you uncover the secret, put it into immediate action. As Dr. Hill states: When a plan comes through to your conscious mind while you are open to the guidance of Infinite Intelligence, accept it with appreciation and gratitude and act on it at once. Do not hesitate, do not argue, challenge, worry, fret about it, or wonder if it’s right. Act on it!</p>
<p>Enjoy your journey. Enjoy the book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorised by the napoleon hill foundation</p>
<p>Business magnate, W. Clement Stone stated that his first commandment of success was to do it now. Following this advice will make us more determined, disciplined and capable of demonstrating the full merit of our potential.</p>
<p>Do It Now! allows you to learn, chapter by chapter, how to use your time wisely and your skills appropriately. You are no longer in danger of being left behind and unable to perform to the fullest of your abilities. You can now not only be a person who grabs the reins and advances forward, but with a little extra effort you can achieve success of extraordinary heights.</p>
<p>As Judith Williamson says, by working through the process outlined in this book you become the scriptwriter for your life’s story and the creator of your own advancement and success. Do It Now! or you will sacrifice all the goodness life has to offer if you fail to do so.</p>
<p>Napoleon Hill, born in a one-room cabin in Wise County, Virginia, had a long and successful career writing, teaching, and lecturing about the principles of success. His work is a monument to individual achievement, the cornerstone of modern motivation. The Napoleon Hill Foundation is a non-profit educational institution perpetuating his philosophy of leadership and self-motivation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a student of Dr. Napoleon Hill for many years, I know that his philosophy works best when it is observable and measurable. It is not always easy to take action, but without action there is no success. Reflect on this for a moment. Great intentions never measure up to the smallest action. However, the tiniest action begins to build a momentum that culminates in your desired success if you build on the previous action daily.</p>
<p>10 Success Secrets pairs Dr. Hill’s philosophy with actions that will move you toward success. I suggest that you try a few, keep a log, and watch your success rate grow. Without the action step, you are missing the master key to your dreams.</p>
<p>First, chart your course; next, plan your method of travel, and third, step into the journey and begin! As you progress, you can then evaluate what actions work best for you.</p>
<p>Look at this book as your treasure map. When you follow it to your destination, you will be rewarded with finding the treasure you seek.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Judith Williamson, Director of the Napoleon Hill World Learning Center, has compiled a book that you can read, enjoy, and apply to help you accomplish what you desire in life. She has used her extensive knowledge of Napoleon Hill’s writings with her experience as a professor on the principles of success to relate to the work of Hill to create a profound message for the reader.</p>
<p>Once you have completed the book, go back and read it again and take the suggestions and repeat them until they become a part of your being. The end result of your reading, study, and application will help you reach your desires. But, most importantly, the ultimate result will be not what you received in the process but the person you become while on your journey to success.</p>
