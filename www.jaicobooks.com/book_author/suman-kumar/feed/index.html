										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How horribly wrong can a boy’s dream of owning a pair of full pants go? Set in a small town in Andhra Pradesh, Ranga Half-Pants is a breathtaking, coming-of-age tale of courage, love, and friendship.</p>
<p>Ranganathan aka Ranga, 14, goes to school after Dasara holidays to discover that he is the only boy in his class still wearing half-pants. All the other boys have moved on to full trousers making Ranga the butt of cruel jokes and bullying. Things reach a real low when his arch-nemesis, Joel, becomes friends with Ranga’s best friend, Kaivalya.</p>
<p>Prasad, 24, is a man forced to live by the sword. Now he wants to give it all up for the love of his life, Tabassum. His rivals, however, have other plans for him.</p>
<p>The worlds of Ranga and Prasad clash on a fateful, violent night. Will Ranga get his full pants? Will Prasad outwit his foes?</p>
