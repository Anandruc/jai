										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Develop New Habits for Financial &amp; Emotional Success</p>
<p>ARE YOU WRESTLING WITH ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS?</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re struggling along from paycheck to paycheck</li>
<li>You’re earning too little to ever afford your dreams</li>
<li>You’ve got too little stored away to live comfortably in retirement</li>
</ul>
<p>THEN THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU!</p>
<p>If you’re like most of us, your years in school did little to prepare you for the challenges of the real world. They are more likely to have planted seeds of financial and emotional failure in your life. These seeds sprout later, sabotaging our most sincere attempts to get ahead and create happy, prosperous lives for ourselves and our families.</p>
<p>This book reverses the damage. It shows you how to identify and reverse the harmful programming you unconsciously received in the classroom, and learn new habits that will set you up for financial and emotional success right now. With the blueprint in this book, you will learn attitudes and abilities that will help you not merely to survive, but to prosper, regardless of whether the economy goes up or goes down. If you want to be rich and happy, read this book!</p>
