										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreword by International bestselling author Tony Buzan</p>
<p>Virtually everyone fears mental deterioration. But in the past thirty years, neuroscientists have discovered that the brain is actually designed to improve throughout life. How can you encourage this improvement? Brain Power shares practical answers in this inspiring, fun-to-read plan for action.</p>
<p>The authors have interviewed physicians, gerontologists, and neuroscientists; studied the habits of men and women who epitomize healthy aging; and applied what they describe in their own lives. The resulting guidance can help you activate unused brain areas, tone mental muscles, and enliven every faculty.</p>
