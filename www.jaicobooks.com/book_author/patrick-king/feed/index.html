<p>Practical methods to never be fooled, stop making mistakes, and avoid traps.</p>
<p>We rarely see the world as it really is.</p>
<p>The Art of Clear Thinking takes an in-depth look at the everyday illusions we come across, and how to defeat them once and for all. What makes us jump to conclusions, evaluate incorrectly, and consistently make errors when we should know better? Why do we act against our own interests so frequently?</p>
<p>It’s just how we’re wired. But it doesn’t have to stay that way. This book gives you the tools to clear the fog and simply think smarter.</p>

<ul>
<li>Think critically</li>
<li>Deconstruct situations</li>
<li>Analyze deeply</li>
<li>Never be fooled</li>
</ul>
<p>How to Think is not a common “think smarter” book. It starts from biological bases of analytical thinking, and how we can re-program ourselves for deep insight. This book provides real, actionable tool after tool, because smart thinking is all about HOW, and not why or what. The bottom line is that you’ll be able to apply this book’s thinking models immediately, until they become habit.</p>
