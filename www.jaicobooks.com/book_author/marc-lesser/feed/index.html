										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the great Zen tradition of teaching stories, Marc Lesser relates his own personal and professional trials as he navigates the delicate path of managing a successful business while staying true to his spiritual roots. Struggling through a difficult economic climate, he also faces the usual challenges of running a growing company—meeting payroll, balancing cashflow, hiring and firing employees, and maintaining relationships with vendors and customers.</p>
<p>Guiding him through these difficulties while providing strength and insight is the practice of Zen. Utilizing his training as a Zen practitioner, the author learns to apply specific teachings such as the eight-fold path directly to work and life.</p>
<p>ZBA: Zen of Business Administration provides readers with intimate, helpful advice, while acknowledging the paradox of applying spiritual practice to the business world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A certain kind of busyness is crucial to life, allowing us to earn a living, create art, and achieve success. But too often it consumes us and we become very busy, expending extraneous effort that gets us nowhere. Marc Lesser’s new book shows us the benefits of doing less in a world that has increasingly embraced more—more desire, activity, things and exhaustion.</p>
<p>Less is about stopping, about the possibility of finding composure in the midst of activity. The ideas and practices that Lesser outlines offer a radical yet simple approach to transforming a lifestyle based on endless to-do lists into a meaningful approach that is more productive in every sense.</p>
