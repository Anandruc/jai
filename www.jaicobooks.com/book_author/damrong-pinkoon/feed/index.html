										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This book reveals whether success is achieved due to one’s own capabilities or due to fortune.</p>
<p>There is a legend on earth about a mysterious eclipse that occurs every century. This is the time when at least a million people journey to find the God of Fortune. However, only one will be successful in finding him, for the journey is long and filled with obstacles – the riddles of life, the caves of alternatives, monsters of the mind, the swords of survival and the choices of life. These barriers will test the physical and mental power of each individual. The special individual who passes each of these tests will be rewarded by the God of Fortune with success and riches throughout his life.</p>
<p>Most people prefer to run away rather than face the challenges of life head on. However, these problems don’t just disappear; they always come back to you later with a vengeance. Only the brave who dare to confront their troubles will survive. Learn to succeed in the working world by means of truth, hard work, bravery, moral principles and good deeds with the self-development methods unveiled in this story.</p>
