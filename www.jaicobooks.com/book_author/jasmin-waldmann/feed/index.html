										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Navigate the journey to holistic health with Amit Malhotra, a high-flying investment banker who loves his gut and all things gourmet. Amit lives the proverbial good life—a loving family, successful career and luxurious life—albeit with a paunch.</p>
<p>After his recovery from covid-19, Amit realizes he needs to revaluate his lifestyle when he loses a close colleague to a fatal heart attack forcing him to face the harsh realities of his fast-paced life.</p>
<p>After this wake up call, the gym-hating, food-binging couch potato recognizes that he will have to change his ways before it takes a toll on him. But will he be able to accomplish this steep climb?</p>
<p>Change Me captures Amit as he discovers his true being—his mind, body and spirit—and marches towards a healthy, fulfilling future.</p>
