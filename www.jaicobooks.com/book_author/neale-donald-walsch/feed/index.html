										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Life was meant to be happy. Do you believe that? It’s true. I know it doesn’t seem like it when you look around, but it’s true. Life was meant to be happy.</p>
<p>You were meant to be happy. And if you are happy, you were meant to be happier. Even if you’re very happy, you can be even happier.</p>
<p>How happy? Just how happy can you be? Well&#8230; you can be happier than God.”</p>
<p>Since the publication of his worldwide bestseller Conversations with God, Neale Donald Walsch has been telling readers that a new understanding of God can change their lives and change the world. Here is Walsch at his best with the message that not only can you be happy, but that you are meant to be happy now!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In direct and spiritually challenging language, Walsch exposes the many ways in which he believes that humanity completely misunderstands God. He describes in clear terms how the world could change overnight if humans accurately comprehended what God is, what God wants, who they are in relation to that, and to each other. Walsch calls this the Missing Data, which if ever embraced and acted on by our species, would create a spiritual revolution across the globe, bringing humanity both inner and outer peace at last.</p>
<p>Does anybody care why our species has been such a failure? Does anybody imagine it has not been? Does anybody want to know how this whole situation can be turned around in the virtual blink of an eye? If you do care about those questions, then you will read this book.</p>
