<p>The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is a story about a priest who falls for a beautiful gypsy girl, Esmeralda. Unable to control his infatuation any longer, he attempts to kidnap her with the help of Quasimodo, the hunchback bell ringer of Notre-Dame. The story forms an intricate web of love, hate, obsession and despair around the characters and shows that how love can elevate, destroy or even beautify people.</p>
