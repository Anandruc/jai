Long-lasting weight loss can be achieved only by changing the way you eat.</p>
<p>To reach your ideal weight, you must move away from diets to eating right. Move away from fads to healthy habits. Thin people stay thin because these habits are embedded in their subconscious and are a part of their daily routine.</p>
<p>Don’t Diet will help you identify 50 stay-thin habits – spread across mind, body and lifestyle – and give you workable cues to adopt them easily. With the help of these cues, you too can stay fit and happy. And of course, thin.</p>
