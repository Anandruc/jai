										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rev. Dada J P Vaswani has always been a raconteur par excellence. His informal discourses as well as his books have always been liberally interspersed with thought-provoking stories, interesting anecdotes and tales from our myths and scriptures, chosen judiciously to bring home the point that he wishes us to absorb. These stories are so memorable, that they linger long in our hearts, allowing us to internalize the message or the value that he has so creatively put across to us!</p>
<p>In this book, we bring together 100 stories chosen from his recent talks and books, neatly packaged with Rev. Dada’s thoughts offered for your reflection, and his trademark practical exercises in the form of tips for you to follow!</p>
<p>Happy reading – and happy reflections!</p>
<p>J P Vaswani needs no introduction to readers of inspirational literature. He is regarded as one of the leading spiritual luminaries of India, a practical philosopher and a man of God whose grace has influenced thousands all over the world.</p>
<p>A gifted writer and brilliant orator, Dada, as he is lovingly called, has addressed distinguished audiences worldwide, communicating only as he can, the positive messages of love, faith, joy and peace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A journey of self-discovery</p>
<p>‘Tatah kim? Tatah kim?’ asked Adi Shankara, centuries ago. What then? Is making money the be-all and end-all of life?</p>
<p>The answer to that question cannot really be found in our diary entries or our schedule of appointments! Our activities cannot indicate the answer either. It is a question that forces one to reflect on the ultimate goal one has set for oneself.</p>
<p>In What Then, J.P. Vaswani expertly illustrates the importance of taking a step back and evaluating life. Are we living in order to die? Or are we living to exist? Or to eat, drink and be merry for we may die soon? Even in the frenetic pursuit of targets and goals, we need to pause and reflect on where we are headed, where our life is taking us, or, where we are trying to reach with our hectic efforts!</p>
<p>What then? Where does one go from here?</p>
