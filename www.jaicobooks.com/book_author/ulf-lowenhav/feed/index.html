										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How can decisions be improved by detecting and managing inherent weaknesses? This book analyses the practical implications of behavioural economics among decision makers to encourage active creative thinking and drive individuals and organizations to make better decisions. Going beyond behavioural economics, this book uses psychology, philosophy and anthropology to demonstrate the myths which govern behaviour, our natural longing for inclusion and the power held by those setting the agenda in our vicinity.</p>
<p>This book enables active thinking and encourages individuals to be a useful asset to their companies by using System 2 thinking—deliberate, slow and controlled thinking to steer the corporate ship in line with the corporate purpose. In order to succeed, you need to be resilient, get your bearings and never give in.</p>
<p>In short, you need to be a contrarian, a sternly resilient contrarian.  </p>
