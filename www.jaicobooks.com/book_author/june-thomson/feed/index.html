										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Dr Watson’s old manuscripts, deliberately unpublished to protect the names of those they concern, are released into the public, a multitude of previously unseen cases are revealed. An American millionaire receives threatening letters from a sinister Black Hand&#8230; A mysterious box terrifies a shop keeper&#8230; Holmes and Watson feel the influence of an old enemy from beyond the grave&#8230; And a tragedy occurs which Sherlock Holmes will never be able to forgive himself for failing to prevent.</p>
<p>From the smoky streets of London to a countryside mental institution, the renowned detective and his faithful sidekick Watson must use all their cunning skills to solve this array of mysteries. With murders, madness and diamonds abound, June Thomson continues the Holmes canon with a brilliance and ingenuity that perfectly captures where Conan Doyle left off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Sherlock Holmes London, reputations are fragile and scandal can be ruinous. In order to protect the names of the good (and not-so-good), Dr Watson comes to the decision that his accounts of some of his friend’s most brilliant cases must never see the light of day. And so he conceals the manuscripts in an old dispatch box, deep in the vaults of a Charing Cross bank&#8230;</p>
<p>Now, outlasting the memories of those they could have harmed, these mysteries finally come to light. An aluminium crutch betrays the criminal who relies upon it for support . . . An Italian Cardinal lies dead in a muddy yard in Spitalfields . . . What do a pair of suspiciously successful gamblers have in common with the Transylvanian mind-reader, Count Rakoczi? And can Holmes and Watson outwit the jewel thief who has the nerve to steal from the King of Scandinavia?</p>
