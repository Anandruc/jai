										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may long for wholeness, but the truth is that it is already here and already ours.</p>
<p>Mindfulness for Beginners invites you to transform your relationship to the way you think, feel, love, work and play, and thereby awaken to and embody who you really are.</p>
<p>This book can be used in three unique ways to implement the benefits of mindfulness in your day-to-day life:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a collection of reflections and practices to be opened and explored at random,</li>
<li>As an illuminating and engaging start-to-finish read, or</li>
<li>As an unfolding ‘lesson-a-day’ primer on mindfulness practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who reads this brilliant book will discover in these pages a valuable distillation of the key attitudes and essential practices. Remember, any change that comes about in your life is primarily because of your own efforts.</p>
