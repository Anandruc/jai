										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As one of the first female F-14 Tomcat fighter pilots in the US Navy, as well as a mom, wife, business consultant, Wall Street Journal bestselling author, and global speaker, Carey Lohrenz knows that the stress we experience can be just as intense as the stress in the cockpit of a fighter jet going Mach 2. But she’s got a secret weapon to prevail: years of training to overcome the specific natures of uncertainty, stress, burnout, anxiety, and pressure.</p>
<p>In Span of Control, Lohrenz walks us through the fundamentals of surviving and succeeding during times of crisis. To thrive when the pressure is on and to improve our performance overall, we’ve got to know what we can and cannot control.</p>
<p>Weaving together eye-opening science, gripping personal stories, insightful interviews, prescriptive advice, and a high-octane dose of encouragement and practicality, Span of Control helps leaders recognize how to focus on what matters most, formulate a plan for success, and communicate what’s possible.</p>
