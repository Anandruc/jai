<p>Afterword By Om Swami</p>
<p>Well, you never have to stand in front of your cupboard and think: what should I wear today? There is only one color. When I was initiated into sannyasa, I thought I had become a different person forever. The reality was far from it.</p>
<p>The only solace: I was not the only one.</p>
<p>Having met numerous seekers who visit our ashram to meet my guru, Om Swami, I realized that most of them had similar woes. My failures were everyday failures for others just as much. They too were dancing to the fickle tunes of their unanchored and untamed minds.</p>
<p>But there was hope. Simple instructions from the ingenious mind of my master rescued me. It is his infallible wisdom that I have tried to capture in this book. I hope the lessons in these pages bring you as much peace and clarity as they brought me.</p>
