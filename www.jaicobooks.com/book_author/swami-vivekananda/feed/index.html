<p>Meditation is considered one of the most essential components in spirituality and used as a means to attain enlightenment. </p>
<p>In this book, Swami Vivekananda, one of the most celebrated spiritual leaders of India, provides an introduction to meditation, its different methods, its power, and how it can bring enlightenment, happiness and peace to our lives. </p>
<p>He delves deeper into the concept through two approachesâ€”meditation through Raja Yoga by controlling the mind and through understanding the oneness of the soul and brahma as has been practiced in Vedanta philosophy. </p>
