										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Typically, the journey to becoming a master salesperson is long and painful, full of trial and error, requiring perseverance and constant self-motivation. But it doesn’t have to be that way!</p>
<p>While pundits may describe sales as an art form, the truth is that – like science – it is based on core principles and practices. In order to get better at sales, a salesperson need only improve on these individual building blocks.</p>
<p>In the Science of Sales, author Pranab Bhalla builds a logical framework for budding professionals on the process of sales. Here you will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right psychological approach</li>
<li>The building blocks of cold calling and business development</li>
<li>The art of questioning</li>
<li>The sales presentation</li>
<li>Understanding buying decisions</li>
<li>Dangling the bait and much, much more!</li>
</ul>
