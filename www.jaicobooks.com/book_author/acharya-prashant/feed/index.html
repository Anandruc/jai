										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is Maya a sly antagonist determined to keep us shackled in our own inner chains? Or is she another name for the game of life, where we could be a master player or a hapless pawn?</p>
<p>Be it the common man who finds Maya synonymous with materialism, or the spiritual man who accords Maya some esoteric imagery, all fail to comprehend her. She is elusive by definition.</p>
<p>Spirituality today has largely become another form of entertainment. However, Acharya Prashant takes us towards a genuine understanding of Maya as she plays out in our daily lives. Drawing on Vedantic seers and philosophers from all ages he makes age-old wisdom accessible in a modern-day context. If you have the courage to let go of your old beliefs, willingness to pay the price for an authentic life and love for the naked truth, this book is for you.</p>
