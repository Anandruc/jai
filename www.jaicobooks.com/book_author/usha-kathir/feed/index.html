										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>24-year old Aditi Sridhar is trying hard to establish herself as a newspaper reporter in Bangalore.</p>
<p>In her first major feature article, Aditi, with her never-say-die spirit, resurrects Purnima, the once celebrated singer and actress from the 60s and now a forgotten and missing star. Soon, Aditi is warned off by an unknown caller. Intrigued and defiant, the feisty girl ropes in her friend Reshmi, a photographer, to help her track Purnima. Her detractors become bolder and more violent.</p>
<p>Will Aditi solve the mystery that shrouds Purnimaâ€™s disappearance? Will she unravel the dubious identities and missing links as she gets closer to Purnima? Or does something more sinister await Aditi as she risks her own life to find Purnima, dead or alive.</p>
