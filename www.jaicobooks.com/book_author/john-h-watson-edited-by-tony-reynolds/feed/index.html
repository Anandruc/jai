										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent decease of one of the descendants of Dr. Watson has brought to light his personal papers. These include a number of stories that Dr. Watson suppressed at the time for various reasons. As all involved are long dead, the inheritor has agreed to the publication of a set the most interesting adventures.</p>
<p>Overall, The Lost Stories is a collection of entertaining, canonically consistent tales whose intentionally understated plots are refreshingly limited in scope, relishing in the quotidian of everyday ‘bad behavior’ – opposed to falling prey to that great pastiche writer’s temptation of crafting a short story of epic proportions populated by an abundance of big name historical figures and playing the ‘what really happened’ game where Massive Historical Event X actually hinged on Holmes’ secret intervention.</p>
