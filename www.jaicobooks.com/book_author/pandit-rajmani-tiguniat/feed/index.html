										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re like most 21st century sojourners you may have had a hard time answering that question. Peace is after all a word from the realm of spirituality. It&#8217;s not always easy to hear the small voice over the cacophony of ringing cell phones the constant blare of the TV and the discordant honks and curses of rush hour.</p>
<p>This book the autobiography of Pandit Rajmani Tigunait provides a glimpse of an entirely different way of living. Readers of TOUCHED BY FIRE may follow this extraordinary man on a journey from his birth place in an ancient village in India to his current home in the rolling hills of north-eastern Pennsylvania where he serves as spiritual head of the Himalayan Institute. Along the way you&#8217;ll meet a variety of teachers who guided Tigunait in crafting a contemplative life filled with spiritual richness wisdom and inner peace.</p>
<p>This book is not a how to guide to enlightenment. Nor is it a call to any particular religious tradition. But in its description of Tigunait&#8217;s life-the years of disciplined study and the struggle to master emotions like anger despair and pride-some of the keys are revealed. And its ultimate message that we&#8217;re all the same beneath our culture religious and political facades is desperately needed in our world of tumult and tears.</p>
