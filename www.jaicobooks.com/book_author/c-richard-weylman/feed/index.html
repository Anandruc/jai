Why are some companies’ once-trusted brands now deemed worthless?</p>
<p>After many years of diligent research and work with a wide range of clients, consultant and speaker, C. Richard Weylman, has the answer to these questions to find out what is working and what isn’t for any organization.</p>
<p>Customers don’t care if a business is different or that its products are unusual. They want to do business with companies willing to make a customer-centric promise of expected outcome: up-front and unconditional. The secret lies in engaging buyers emotionally by getting to know their taste and style and deliver solely from their perspective to profoundly elevate business performance.</p>
<p>The Power of Why shows you how to elevate your business performance regardless of your situation or position. Offering the same actionable, hands-on strategies Weylman has used to help companies of all sizes grow in the toughest conditions.</p>
