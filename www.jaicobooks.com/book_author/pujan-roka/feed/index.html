										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bhagavad Gita has been considered a scriptural summary of ancient teachings and wisdom of the East. It has withstood the test of time for thousands of years and has been studied in the contexts of philosophy, theology, and literature. Bhagavad Gita on Effective Leadership is the first to compare its wisdom with theories and practices of leadership. Contemporary topics such as ‘emotional intelligence’ and ‘servant leadership’ were already discussed in the Bhagavad Gita thousands of years ago. This book explains how those and many other leadership topics were explored in the ancient text and how they are still relevant today.</p>
