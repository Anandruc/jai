										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Research shows that CSR improves long-term business performance and that consumers prefer to patronise organisations with strong histories of social responsibility. Today’s customers and employees are speaking with their values as well as their wallets! Consumers are sensitive to empty promises and want brands to be committed to the planet, sustainability and other social issues.</p>
<p>This book argues that trust is at stake for every organisation and is the reason why communications strategies must respond authentically. If you can’t be authentic about social initiatives, then don&#8217;t do it because CSR is not a publicity tool! Yet some see the relationship as nothing but a marketing trick—an organisation&#8217;s blatant self-promotion.</p>
<p>Inside these pages you will find invaluable insights from established companies like Tata, Dabur, and ITC, alongside interviews with global business leaders and emerging social entrepreneurs responding to this shifting perspective of CSR worldwide and in India. This book will define the real role of PR in CSR and what that relationship should be.</p>
