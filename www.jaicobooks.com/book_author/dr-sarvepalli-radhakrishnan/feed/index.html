<p>Mahatma Gandhi’s life was an experiment with truth. Put your principles to real practice—this was his message to the contemporary world.</p>
<p>To him God was Truth and Truth was God. Here are essays and reflections on Mahatma Gandhi, one of the outstanding personalities not only of our time but of all times.</p>
<p>Gandhiji was the greatest moral force in Indian history. For the accomplishment of liberty, justice, and peace, he rediscovered the old techniques of Ahimsa and Satyagraha. He revealed to the masses a power not of rifles and machine guns, but the power innate in each individual, a power which this war-haunted world can exploit fully in making wars impossible.</p>
<p>This book contains tribute to the Father of the Nation, from prominent thinkers like C.F. Andrews, Aldous Huxley, Lin Yutang, A.Coomaraswamy, Sri Aurobindo and many others. Some of Gandhiji’s most distinct and famous speeches are brought together in an appendix in this volume.</p>
