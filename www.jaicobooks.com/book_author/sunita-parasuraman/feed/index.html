										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Panchatantra, one of the world’s greatest collections of tales, was compiled in India by a learned Brahmin named Vishnusharman, more than 2,000 years ago. These stories were meant to impart worldly wisdom to the dull-witted sons of a king, and have since travelled the world, awakening intelligence in readers across centuries.</p>
<p>Arthur Ryder, a Professor of Sanskrit at the University of California, translated the Sanskrit original into English in 1925. This re-write of the Ryder translation is aimed at today’s busy reader and the original interwoven stories are presented separately. Archaic English prose makes way for modern language. The “Principle” clearly and simply summarizes the wisdom imparted at the end of each story. Arthur Ryder’s brilliant introduction and charming verse translations remain untouched.</p>
<p>This book is a rare coming together of simple format, rich poetry, practical wisdom and lofty ideals, a vehicle to transmit the simple and timeless truths of the Panchatantra in a concise manner to a modern audience.</p>
