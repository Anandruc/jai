										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you’re at a job interview or a cocktail party, searching LinkedIn or swiping right on a dating site, you want (no—need) to understand what people are really thinking, regardless of what they’re saying. Understanding what others are trying to tell you with their posture, hand gestures, eye contact (or lack thereof) or incessant fiddling with their iPhone might all be even more important than what you’re projecting yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do they plan on making a deal with your company?</li>
<li>Are they lying to you?</li>
<li>Can you trust this person with your most intimate secrets?</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing what others are thinking can tell you when to run with an opportunity and when not to waste your time, whether at work, in a crucial negotiation or on a promising first date.</p>
<p>Bestselling authors Mark Bowden and Tracey Thomson illustrate the essential points of body language with examples from everyday life, leavened with humour and insights that you can use to your advantage in virtually any situation.</p>
