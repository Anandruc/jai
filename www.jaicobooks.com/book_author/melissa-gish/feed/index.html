										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobel Prize winner Tenzing Gyatso, one of history’s most respected and beloved seekers of peace in modern times is better known as the 14th Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet. Anticipating assassination from Chairman Mao he had to flee his homeland as he knew that he would be able to protect his people only if he was alive. Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru allowed the Tibetans to headquarter their spiritual leader in the city of Dharamshala, where it still exists today. Though the Dalai Lama has lived in exile in India since 1959, he remains the unifying figure of Tibet’s non-violent struggle against Communist China.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama believes in diplomacy through friendship, encourages people to seek harmony and understanding among different religions and is keen on promoting Tibetan language and culture. Read about this exiled spiritual leader’s life.</p>
