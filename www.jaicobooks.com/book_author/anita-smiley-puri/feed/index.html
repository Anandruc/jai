										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adityanama offers an exclusive look into the legendary banker Aditya Puri’s life through the eyes of his better half, Smiley Puri. Everyone knows Aditya Puri in the world of finance, but very little is known about the man behind those billion dollar deals and ideas that revolutionised India’s private banking sector.</p>
<p>Smiley provides readers a window into the famously discreet banker’s personal life and professional journey dotted with stories revealing Aditya’s sense of humour, his love for food and pranks, his management style, and his commitment to family and friends. She fondly recollects incidents from Aditya’s college life, his Citi Bank and HDFC Bank years, and his precious moments with her and their children as a true family man.</p>
<p>Never-before-seen family photographs from Smiley’s personal collection lend colour to her vibrant narration. This book gives a rare chance to all those who are fascinated with the world of banking and bankers to know what makes the master banker with the Midas touch tick.</p>
