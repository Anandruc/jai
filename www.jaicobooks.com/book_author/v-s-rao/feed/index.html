										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now in Hindi</p>
<p>Navagraha Purana chronicles in fascinating detail the birth, life and glory of the Nine Planets, the powerful astral deities who are the ultimate arbiters of man’s destiny.</p>
<p>This compelling narrative paints a delightfully intimate portrait of the Navagrahas. Surya subdues his raging heat to please his beloved Samjna. Chandra lusts after his guru’s wife and is cursed to wane each month. Kuja emerges from a drop of perspiration on Shiva’s brow. Budha marries Ila, who is his wife for one month and a prince in the next. Brhaspati forgives his wife’s adultery and curses an amorous apsara to be born as a monkey. Usana becomes Sukra when he is swallowed by a furious Shiva. Sanaischara requests the Trimurti to ensure he inspire fear in all living beings. Rahu and Ketu wreak their vengeance on Surya and Chandra by swallowing them.</p>
<p>In an irresistible medley of drama, romance, humour and devotion, Navagraha Purana entertains and informs as it asserts that no one is exempt from the implacable influence of the Nine Planets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Warrior Sage chronicles the legendary journey of Parasuram through the various yugas. Believed to be an immortal and one of the greatest warriors in the Hindu mythology, Parasuram is present in both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, thus marking his presence in the Treta as well as in the Dwapara Yuga.</p>
<p>Parasuram is the embodiment of duty and justice. His actions—going on a kshatriya killing spree to avenge his father’s death; punishing the sea god Varuna for encroaching on the holy land Gokarna; challenging Lord Ram to a duel for breaking Lord Shiva’s bow; waging a war with Bhishma for the injustice done to Amba …—all point to his firm belief in truth and righteousness.</p>
<p>Parasuram’s story shows you that you don’t have to be stuck in a mould others expect you to be in; you are free to choose your path, your truth. Read on to discover the many heroic feats of Parasuram and be inspired to take charge of your life.</p>
