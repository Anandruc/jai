										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now in Marathi</p>
<p>A wedding in India is a complex affair that involves more than just the bride and groom &#8211; it includes every member of both the families. Chetan Bhagat’s 2 States is the author’s personal account of the challenges that he and his wife faced in convincing their parents to agree to their love marriage.</p>
<p>The novel is a hilarious take on the complications that arise within Indian families, especially when youngsters from diverse backgrounds fall in love and decide to tie the knot. As Bhagat aptly portrays, not only should the couple be willing to wed, but their families have to accept the union too!</p>
<p>Bhagat leads his readers through the love story of Ananya and Krish, who belong to two culturally diverse states in India. They fall deeply in love during their time together in college, and as time goes on, they decide to get married. To be happily married ever after, though, they have an arduous task ahead. They have to persuade their parents, and for this, Krish must figure out a way to fit into a traditional south Indian household, and Ananya must try and compete with her Punjabi counterparts.</p>
<p>Bhagat belts out a quirky and witty novel that’s peppered with humor, and the contrast of a Punjabi and Tamilian household is brought out through this book.</p>
