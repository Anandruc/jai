										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Practical, real-life methods to become the luckiest person you know, with no lucky charms or rituals needed to beat the odds.</p>
<p>Luck—we’re not sure what it is, but we know we want it on our side. Is luck a cosmic force that we can randomly stumble upon, or is there something real that people we consider lucky have discovered? The Science of Being Lucky is an in-depth look at what all lucky people have in common and how they set themselves up for success time after time.</p>
<p>Put success into your own hands, not fate’s.</p>
<p>The Science of Being Lucky takes you on a science-based journey into what luck is, what we think it is, and how to get more of it in your life. The journey begins by breaking down and defining the lucky breaks, coincidences, and serendipitous events in our lives—then delves into the specific traits, life factors, and perspectives that create lucky outcomes.</p>
<p>This book will open your eyes to what is behind each moment you would call lucky and give you a concrete action plan to create more of the same. Luck doesn’t have to be just fantasy. Here’s what’s inside to make you immune to bad luck:<br />
•  Popular methods for luck—do they work? (Some do, some do not)<br />
•  Avoiding bad luck internally and externally<br />
•  Three traits that practically manufacture luck<br />
•  Max Gunther’s famous “strategic luck planning” approach to life</p>
