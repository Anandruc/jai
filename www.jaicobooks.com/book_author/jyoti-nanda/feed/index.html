										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Karma kurry: book 1</p>
<p>The compelling stories in this book are of ordinary citizens who have unleashed the spirit within, with extraordinary consequences, radically changing society for the better. The list includes globally eminent names like Meera Sanyal, Michael Norton, Arun Maira, Bill Drayton and Kumi Naidoo as well as unsung heroes like Lakshman Singh, Thangsingh Chinkholal and many others. Irrespective of their field, these are people who have reached out beyond their own life to help others, to be and to lead the change. Their stories will inspire all of us to recognize our own power to be a champion of change, reinforce the positive in society and leave an imprint on the sands of time.</p>
<p>JERONINIO “JERRY”ALMEIDA is one of the world’s most innovative fundraisers and missionary entrepreneurs. He is a celebrated inspirational speaker, teacher, executive coach and management consultant.</p>
