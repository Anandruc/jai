										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the relentless growth of passive investing—investors blindly following the market—the opportunities for a smart investor to profit by betting against the crowd should be greater than ever.</p>
<p>Yet, being a contrarian is hard work. You need to adopt a sceptical mindset: a flexible mode of thinking that allows you to stand back and spot when the market’s view of the world is badly out of touch with reality—and the best way to profit when reality eventually reasserts itself.</p>
<p>In The Sceptical Investor, John Stepek, Executive Editor of MoneyWeek, pulls together the latest research on behavioural finance, and examples from well-known contrarian investors, to offer practical techniques to help you spot opportunities in common investment situations, from turnaround plays to bubbles and busts, that others in the market miss.</p>
