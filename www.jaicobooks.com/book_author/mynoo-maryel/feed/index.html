										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all go through profound experiences. We all have a story to share. This book begins as a wake-up call to parts of us that have long been asleep and ends as a grand invitation to an adventurous life. All that’s required are some timely reminders and something wonderful to light our way. The Be Book offers us those reminders and that light.</p>
<p>Part autobiography and part hands-on guidebook, it is a collection of inspiring journeys in the different phases of Mynoo’s life. They have been penned down for you to learn the most important lesson: Live life in a way that ‘being’ becomes your state of choice and ‘doing’ just flows flawlessly from there.</p>
