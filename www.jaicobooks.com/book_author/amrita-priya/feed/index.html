										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Set in the enchanting isles of Lakshadweep, Two Quality Ladies is an unexpected tale of romance between three exceptional people. Offering a generous slice of life, it explores the physical and emotional turmoil of relationships between man and woman, and woman and woman.</p>
<p>Musheer, a successful businessman seems to have it all – riches, success and a beautiful wife, Omera. On the outside, his life is paradise. In reality, he and Omera are gradually drifting apart. Her rejection drives him headlong into the arms of beautiful young Kinja. But Kinja has her own secrets. Who is her mysterious benefactor, who communicates to her only through letters? And what does Omera know about this matter?</p>
<p>As the trio explore the boundaries of their relationship, Two Quality Ladies reminds us that love is limitless and cannot be constrained by established norms.</p>
