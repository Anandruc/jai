										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Given the fervent renewed appreciation for the contributions Albert Einstein has bestowed on humanity, physicist and popular science writer Barry Parker dedicates a book to explaining in the clearest possible terms to the broadest possible audience the meaning and beauty of Einstein’s theories.</p>
<p>While tracing the story of Einstein’s life, Parker seizes on the crucial groundbreaking theories that Einstein envisioned. Through Parker&#8217;s eloquence, eye for detail, and clever use of Einsteinian cartoons and vivid illustrations, he enables the reader to see and appreciate for perhaps the first time the full meaning and scope of Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity and General Theory of Relativity. Parker then guides the reader to the next step in Einstein&#8217;s revelations: the possibility of time travel. Parker’s incomparable gift for language captures Einstein’s uniqueness, singular brilliance, and stunning theories.</p>
<p>The clarity of the writing coupled with the many illustrations will drive home the point why so many consider Einstein to be the greatest scientist who ever lived and Time magazine named Albert Einstein “Person of the Century.”</p>
