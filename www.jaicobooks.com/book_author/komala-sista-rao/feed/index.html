<p>Komala Sista Rao, a former singer and mother of pop singer and stage actress Suneeta Rao, presents a compilation of her family’s culinary legacy – well-chosen, delectable vegetarian Andhra home recipes.</p>
<p>The Andhra Cookbook breaks stereotypes of Andhra food being all about chillies or too spicy for most palates. Offering recipes with a depth of flavours and several ideas for novices and experts alike, this cookbook will encourage you to relish and experiment with Andhra cooking.</p>
<p>With a wide selection of vegetable curries, dals, stews and chutneys, this book provides a keen insight into the region’s cuisine. It can also serve as a well-organised guide that includes detailed explanations about preparation methods and suggested menus to understand how to combine dishes.</p>
<p>These recipes carry with them the creativity, labour and love of generations of women in the author’s family, finely crafted and perfected over the years.</p>
<p>The excellent food photography inside will help you instantly connect with the rich and delicious world of Andhra cuisine.</p>
