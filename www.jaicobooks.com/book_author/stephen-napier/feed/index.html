										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first few years of the war were nothing short of disastrous, and author Stephen Napier shows how Churchill’s strategies—and his desire not to be the first British prime minister to surrender the nation—brought the war effort to the brink of ruin and back again.</p>
<p>Did his series of retaliatory raids in response to a German accidental bombing help cause the Blitz?</p>
<p>Were plans already at large for the US to join the war, with Churchill as the primary puppet master?</p>
<p>Napier explores all this and more in a shocking examination of Churchill’s leadership using first-person accounts from his peers and his electorate.</p>
