										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a crisp winter morning, Richard, a successful, self-made CEO runs into Zoya, a quirky, free-spirited artist. The meeting leaves them struggling to find a balance between what they believe about life, and what is actually out there.</p>
<p>What You Seek is Seeking You is a heart-warming tale about what happens when you are forced to question everything you ever knew to be true. Refreshingly honest, it helps you rethink some of your most fundamental beliefs – the ones that hold the very canvas of your life in place, but which in fact may be limiting you.</p>
<p>Setting the scene with a lively fable, Azim &amp; Brian share insightful and tangible ways to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invite Positive Coincidences and Attract What You Seek</li>
<li>Set Goals, Remain Focused and yet Stay Detached from the Outcome</li>
<li>Enhance Your Business Acumen</li>
</ul>
