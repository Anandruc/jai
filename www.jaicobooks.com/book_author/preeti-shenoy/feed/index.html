										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now in Telugu</p>
<p>Set across two cities in India in the early eighties, Life is What You Make it is a gripping account of a few significant years of Ankita’s life.</p>
<p>Ankita Sharma has the world at her feet. She is young, good-looking, smart and has tonnes of friends and boys swooning over her. She also manages to get into a premier management school for her MBA.</p>
<p>Six months later, she is a patient in a mental health hospital.</p>
<p>Life has cruelly and coldly snatched that which meant the most to her and she must now fight to get it all back.</p>
<p>It is a deeply moving and inspiring account of growing up, of the power of faith and how determination and an indomitable spirit can overcome even what destiny throws at you.</p>
<p>A tale, at its core a love-story that makes us question our beliefs about ourselves and our concept of sanity, and forces us to believe that life is truly what one makes it.</p>
