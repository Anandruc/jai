										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to Overcome Life’s Difficulties</p>
<p>Many people today believe that they are seeking happiness, yet their efforts only make them more and more unhappy. The Laws of Happiness is a basic introduction to the teachings of Ryuho Okawa, illustrating his core philosophy. He teaches that if people can master The Principles of Happiness &#8211; Love, Wisdom, Self-Reflection, and Progress &#8211; they can make their life shine in both this world and the other, for these principles, based on Okawa’s experiences, are the four methods of escaping suffering. Okawa shows you how to free yourself from the suffering of selfish love, how to stop bemoaning your ignorance and learn through study how to cut off negative spiritual influences through self-reflection, and how your strong thoughts will be realized. These are the keys to creating a spiritual age that is to come, which Ryuho Okawa calls “The Age of the Sun.”</p>
