										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jaico illustarted classics series is a collection of beloved children’s classics read by generations all over the world. Rich with adventures and thrills, these immortal stories with vivid illustrations are designed to delight young readers.</p>
<p>Banished from England for seeking to marry against his father’s wishes, Ivanhoe joins Richard the Lion Heart on a crusade in the Holy Land. It is a dangerous time in England when power-hungry and ruthless lords battle and bring bloodshed and suffering to the land. No one knows who to trust, least of all the young knight, Ivanhoe, returning home disowned and dishonored.</p>
<p>This is an exciting story of romance and adventure! King Richard the Lion-Hearted&#8230; Robin Hood&#8230; the fair princess Rowena&#8230; the bewitching Rebecca&#8230; and the most gallant, fearless knight of all, Ivanhoe.</p>
