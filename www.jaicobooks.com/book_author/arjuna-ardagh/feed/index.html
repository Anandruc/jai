										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreword by Warren Farrell PhD</p>
<p>Conscious Men guides a man to look within and discover his purpose and mission; to be in touch with his feelings but not be ruled by his feelings; to live a life that is in pursuit of his path, while honoring his commitments.</p>
<p>The authors explore 12 qualities of the “New Masculinity”. Each chapter offers a vivid portrait of each quality, with insights about how it is influenced by biochemistry. It presents a roadmap for the challenges men face today in living their fullest potential, as well as dozens of suggested practices for how to develop these qualities.</p>
<p>The book also has a “To Women” section for each chapter with insights about how to recognize a good and trustworthy man, as well as how to support a man to bring the best out of himself.</p>
<p>Be conscious of your mission and purpose; be a man you always aspired to be!</p>
