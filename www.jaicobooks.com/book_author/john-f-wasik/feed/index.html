										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seventy years after his death, Nikola Tesla has become a rock star. World-changing inventions made him a celebrity in his own time, but something otherworldly makes him transcend his era and remain an eternal beacon for our civilization. Tesla’s prescient visions and schematics of a future where energy, science, and world peace co-exist elevate him above the mere title of “inventor.” His ideas and inventions are still shaping our present and future in profound ways. In Nikola Tesla, John F. Wasik not only looks at how Tesla arrived at his inventions; he also illuminates how you can tap into the same source of creation within yourself.</p>
