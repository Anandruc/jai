										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>International Bestseller &#8211; Now in Gujarati</p>
<p>A lot of professors give talks titles titled The Lat Lecture. Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them. And while they speak, audiences can’t help but mull the same question: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy?</p>
<p>When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn’t have to imagine it as his last, science he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave – “Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams” – wasn’t about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because “time is all you have&#8230; and you may find one day that you have less than you think”). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living.</p>
<p>In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humor, inspiration, and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form. It is a book that will be shared for generations to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now in Gujarati</p>
<p>Canakya’s Arthasastra deals with the different aspects of managing a kingdom, including management of men. The principles contained in Canakya’s work have the unique distinction of being used successfully in practice to achieve good results on a sustainable basis. The management principles used in the USA or in Japan are derived from their own cultural background. There exists enough evidence to show that these systems, even when meticulously and earnestly adopted in India, rarely take roots or produce the desired results. We need to look for those principles that make sense in our own social and work culture and which would hopefully deliver better results for all concerned &#8211; the customers, the investors, the employees and the society. This book on the management philosophy and practice of Canakya is the author’s earnest attempt to help Indian readership to become familiar with the great work of the First Total Management Guru of the world.</p>
