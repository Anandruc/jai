										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now in Assamese</p>
<p>Journey with a modern-day disciple of Chanakya as he goes from being an aimless youth to the richest man in the world, inspiring a whole nation to take up study of Sanskrit and ancient Indian literature for business success.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this book does not have a single character with a name.</p>
<p>The story is about you and your journey through life. While you flip through the pages, you may well find yourself walking the hero&#8217;s path to bring out the Chanakya inside you.</p>
<p>The book can be read by a parent or a young adult, by a business tycoon or an academic scholar, with equal ease and interest. This is a book for the people; a book that makes you think.</p>
<p>Donâ€™t put it down until you discover the Chanakya in You!</p>
