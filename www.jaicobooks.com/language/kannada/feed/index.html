										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the unfettered story of Ashneer Grover-the favourite and misunderstood poster boy of Start-up India.<br />
Raw, gut-wrenching in its honesty and completely from the heart, this is storytelling at its finest.</p>
<p>A young boy with a &#8216;refugee&#8217; tag growing up in Delhi&#8217;s Malviya Nagar outpaces his circumstances by becoming a rank-holder at the pinnacle of academic excellence in India-IIT Delhi. He goes on to do an MBA from the hallowed halls of IIM Ahmedabad, builds a career as an investment banker at Kotak Investment Banking and AmEx, and is pivotal in the making of two unicorns-Grofers, as CFO, and BharatPe, as co-founder.</p>
<p>As a judge on the popular TV show Shark Tank India, Ashneer becomes a household name even as his life turns upside down. Controversy, media spotlight, garrulous social media chatter descend, making it difficult to distinguish fact from fiction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Shiva does not spell religion. Shiva spells responsibility—our ability to take our very life process in our hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>—Sadhguru</p>
<p>&#8216;Shi-va&#8217; is &#8216;that which is not&#8217;, a primordial emptiness; Shiva is also the first-ever yogi, Adiyogi, the one who first perceived this emptiness. Adiyogi is symbol and myth, historic figure and living presence, creator and destroyer, outlaw and ascetic, cosmic dancer and passionate lover, all at once.A book like no other, this extraordinary document is a tribute to Shiva, the Adiyogi, by a living yogi; a chronicle of the progenitor of mysticism by a contemporary mystic. Here science and philosophy merge seamlessly, so do silence and sound, question and answer&#8211;to capture the unspeakable enigma of Adiyogi in a spellbinding wave of words and ideas that will leave one entranced, transformed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jay Shetty, social media superstar and host of the #1 podcast ‘On Purpose’, distils the timeless wisdom he learned as a practising monk into practical steps anyone can take every day to live a less anxious, more meaningful life. Over the past three years, Jay Shetty has become one of the world’s most popular influencers. One of his clips was the most watched video on Facebook last year, with over 360 million views. His social media following totals over 32 million, he has produced over 400 viral videos, which have amassed more than 5 billion views, and his podcast, ‘On Purpose’, is consistently ranked the world’s #1 health-related podcast. In this inspiring, empowering book, Shetty draws on his time as a monk in the Vedic tradition to show us how we can clear the roadblocks to our potential and power. Drawing on ancient wisdom and his own rich experiences in the ashram, “Think Like a Monk” reveals how to overcome negative thoughts and habits, and access the calm and purpose that lie within all of us. The lessons monks learn are profound but often abstract. Shetty transforms them into advice and exercises we can all apply to reduce stress, improve focus, improve relationships, identify our hidden abilities, increase self-discipline and give the gifts we find in ourselves to the world. Shetty proves that everyone can – and should – think like a monk.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now in Kannada</p>
<p>Kautilya, also known as Chanakya, is India’s most illustrious political economist of all time. He regarded economic activity as the driving force behind the functioning of any political dispensation. In fact, he went to the extent of saying that revenue should take priority over the army because sustaining the army was possible out of a well-managed revenue system.</p>
<p>Kautilya advocated limiting the taxation power of the State, having low rates of taxation, maintaining a gradual increase in taxation and most importantly devising a tax structure that ensured compliance. He strongly encouraged foreign trade, basing it on the premise that for a successful trade contract to be established, it had to be beneficial to all. He emphasised State control and investment in land, water and mining.</p>
<p>Kautilya was a true statesman who bridged the gap between experience and vision. For Kautilya, good governance was paramount. He suggested built-in checks and balances in systems and procedures for the containment of malpractices. Many postulates of Kautilya’s philosophy of political economy are applicable to contemporary times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now in Kannada</p>
<p>This is one of the many inspiring stories from the renowned “Motivator” Dr. G. Francis Xavier. Evidently, this harvest of stories has been gleaned from lands he visited and books he read. Xavier, who conducts full-house personal growth courses has brought out this compendium in an interactive form, making the reader give the answers at the end of the story which is a novel approach. Stories and examples are the best way to inspire, and this reasonably priced volume could be useful gifts for people. It is useful for preachers, speakers and teachers.</p>
<p>The book appeals to readers of all ages except the morose and irredeemable negaholics (negative thinking addicts) and anti-reading teenagers. It has stories to inspire and promises uninterrupted chuckles till the end. There are also quotations on success.</p>
