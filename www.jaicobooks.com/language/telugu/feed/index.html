										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re like most 21st century sojourners you may have had a hard time answering that question. Peace is after all a word from the realm of spirituality. It&#8217;s not always easy to hear the small voice over the cacophony of ringing cell phones the constant blare of the TV and the discordant honks and curses of rush hour.</p>
<p>This book the autobiography of Pandit Rajmani Tigunait provides a glimpse of an entirely different way of living. Readers of TOUCHED BY FIRE may follow this extraordinary man on a journey from his birth place in an ancient village in India to his current home in the rolling hills of north-eastern Pennsylvania where he serves as spiritual head of the Himalayan Institute. Along the way you&#8217;ll meet a variety of teachers who guided Tigunait in crafting a contemplative life filled with spiritual richness wisdom and inner peace.</p>
<p>This book is not a how to guide to enlightenment. Nor is it a call to any particular religious tradition. But in its description of Tigunait&#8217;s life-the years of disciplined study and the struggle to master emotions like anger despair and pride-some of the keys are revealed. And its ultimate message that we&#8217;re all the same beneath our culture religious and political facades is desperately needed in our world of tumult and tears.</p>

<p>In the game of cricket, having scored 99 runs, when a bats-man stands poised on the threshold of that much coveted century, he experiences the moment that is best associated with Ganesha.</p>
<p>Fear and uncertainty envelope him; between him and his achievement stand hurdles, both real and imaginary: a possible spin from the bowler can overwhelm him, his own anxiety can paralyze him, cheering fans can distract him. He needs divine intervention then. He needs to focus, get rid of all hurdles, perform, get the final run, and achieve what he so longs for. In other words, he needs to think of Ganapati.</p>

<p>Each generation produces its “literature of power.” This type of writing literally has the power to change the reader’s life. In this tradition. In The Greatest Salesman In The World is destined to influence countless lives.</p>
<p>Here is the legend of Hafid, a camel boy of two thousand years ago, and his burning desire to improve his lowly position in life. To prove his potential ability, he is dispatched from Bethlehem by his master, the great caravan merchant, Pathros, to sell only one robe. He fails and instead, in a moment of pity, gives the robe to warm a newborn baby in a cave near the inn.</p>
<p>Hafid returns to the caravan in shame but is accompanied by a bright star shining above his head. This phenomenon is interpreted by Pathros to be a sign from the gods, and he gives Hafid ten ancient scrolls, which contain the wisdom necessary for the boy to achieve all his ambitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now in Telugu</p>
<p>Kautilya, also known as Chanakya, is India’s most illustrious political economist of all time. He regarded economic activity as the driving force behind the functioning of any political dispensation. In fact, he went to the extent of saying that revenue should take priority over the army because sustaining the army was possible out of a well-managed revenue system.</p>
<p>Kautilya advocated limiting the taxation power of the State, having low rates of taxation, maintaining a gradual increase in taxation and most importantly devising a tax structure that ensured compliance. He strongly encouraged foreign trade, basing it on the premise that for a successful trade contract to be established, it had to be beneficial to all. He emphasised State control and investment in land, water and mining.</p>
<p>Kautilya was a true statesman who bridged the gap between experience and vision. For Kautilya, good governance was paramount. He suggested built-in checks and balances in systems and procedures for the containment of malpractices. Many postulates of Kautilya’s philosophy of political economy are applicable to contemporary times.</p>
