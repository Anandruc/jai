										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now in Hindi</p>
<p>In the game of cricket, having scored 99 runs, when a bats-man stands poised on the threshold of that much coveted century, he experiences the moment that is best associated with Ganesha.</p>
<p>Fear and uncertainty envelope him; between him and his achievement stand hurdles, both real and imaginary: a possible spin from the bowler can overwhelm him, his own anxiety can paralyze him, cheering fans can distract him. He needs divine intervention then. He needs to focus, get rid of all hurdles, perform, get the final run, and achieve what he so longs for. In other words, he needs to think of Ganapati.</p>

<p>Mohandas K. Gandhi, known as Mahatma (‘great soul’) Gandhi, is revered worldwide for his non violent action in freeing India from British rule. Discover his journey from family and home in the provinces to an early arranged marriage, his solo sojourn in England towards a career in law, and his transformation from a timid barrister in South Africa to India’s foremost negotiator with the British power structure.</p>
<p>The narrative also illuminates Indian society and the caste system from the latter half of the 19th century up to World War II, covering British colonial rule, racism in South Africa and India, and Hinduism. We also glimpse the controversial aspects of Gandhi’s choices. How he was largely an absentee husband and father. How, after siring four children, he took a vow of celibacy, yet formed attachments to several young, female Western devotees through the years. And how, ultimately, it was his role as a compromiser who believed in Hindus and Muslims in a free, united India that led to his assassination.</p>

<p>Each generation produces its “literature of power.” This type of writing literally has the power to change the reader’s life. In this tradition. In The Greatest Salesman In The World is destined to influence countless lives.</p>
<p>Here is the legend of Hafid, a camel boy of two thousand years ago, and his burning desire to improve his lowly position in life. To prove his potential ability, he is dispatched from Bethlehem by his master, the great caravan merchant, Pathros, to sell only one robe. He fails and instead, in a moment of pity, gives the robe to warm a newborn baby in a cave near the inn.</p>
<p>Hafid returns to the caravan in shame but is accompanied by a bright star shining above his head. This phenomenon is interpreted by Pathros to be a sign from the gods, and he gives Hafid ten ancient scrolls, which contain the wisdom necessary for the boy to achieve all his ambitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now in Hindi</p>
<p>Kautilya, also known as Chanakya, is India’s most illustrious political economist of all time. He regarded economic activity as the driving force behind the functioning of any political dispensation. In fact, he went to the extent of saying that revenue should take priority over the army because sustaining the army was possible out of a well-managed revenue system.</p>
<p>Kautilya advocated limiting the taxation power of the State, having low rates of taxation, maintaining a gradual increase in taxation and most importantly devising a tax structure that ensured compliance. He strongly encouraged foreign trade, basing it on the premise that for a successful trade contract to be established, it had to be beneficial to all. He emphasised State control and investment in land, water and mining.</p>
<p>Kautilya was a true statesman who bridged the gap between experience and vision. For Kautilya, good governance was paramount. He suggested built-in checks and balances in systems and procedures for the containment of malpractices. Many postulates of Kautilya’s philosophy of political economy are applicable to contemporary times.</p>
