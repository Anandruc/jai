										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now in Marathi</p>
<p>Canakya’s Arthasastra deals with the different aspects of managing a kingdom, including management of men. The principles contained in Canakya’s work have the unique distinction of being used successfully in practice to achieve good results on a sustainable basis. The management principles used in the USA or in Japan are derived from their own cultural background. There exists enough evidence to show that these systems, even when meticulously and earnestly adopted in India, rarely take roots or produce the desired results. We need to look for those principles that make sense in our own social and work culture and which would hopefully deliver better results for all concerned &#8211; the customers, the investors, the employees and the society. This book on the management philosophy and practice of Canakya is the author’s earnest attempt to help Indian readership to become familiar with the great work of the First Total Management Guru of the world.</p>

<p>In The Steve Jobs Way, Jay Elliot gives the reader the opportunity of seeing Steve Jobs as only his closest associates have ever seen him, and to learn what has made him – and the mystique of his management style – capable of creating tools so extraordinary that they have remade three industries and have transformed the way we create, consume, and communicate with each other.</p>
<p>Jay Elliot worked side by side with Steve as Senior Vice President of Apple and brings us his deep insider perspective of Steve’s singular iLeadership style – which encompasses four major principles: product, talent, organization, marketing.</p>
<p>Jay shares the lessons that come out of Steve’s intuitive approach to show how the creative and technological brilliance of iLeadership can be utilized to drive breakthroughs in any organization, irrespective of size.</p>
