										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sai Baba of Shirdi is a phenomenon. In all of India’s history, there has never been another like him. He is not a conventional saint. He wrote no critique of the Bhagvad Gita or the Upanishads or any other holy work. He made no pretensions to scholarship yet he had a profound insight into both Hindu and Islamic scriptures. He founded no ashram or peetham, wrote no tome, initiated no disciple to take over from him. He performed ‘miracles’ but in no manner of means to impress anyone, devotee or otherwise. Sai Baba in every way remains unique.</p>
<p>Born about 20 years before the ‘Sepoy’ mutiny in the 19th century in Marathwada, the home of medieval saints of Maharashtra, he came in his late 20’s to Shirdi, an insignificant hamlet in Ahmednagar district and spent the remaining 50 years of his life there until his mahasamadhi. Today Shirdi is a centre of pilgrimage for lakhs of Sai Baba’s devotees. This book is a complete account of his life and mission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreword By His Holiness The Dalai Lama</p>
<p>Preface by Rabbi David Rosen</p>
<p>Practical wisdom, a connection to the Divine, and global action – these are the traits of Pujya Swami Chidanand Saraswati that have made him one of India’s most renowned and beloved spiritual teachers. His lessons are profoundly simple, frequently wrapped in humor, and applicable to all.</p>
<p>By God’s Grace traces Pujya Swami’s story from the jungles of India to the company of various world leaders, from Himalayan villages to the podiums of the United Nations, the World Economic Forum and other venues of global exchange. His projects are unprecedented and include a clean-up of the 1,560-mile-long Ganges River and a six-million-word encyclopedia of Hinduism.</p>
<p>Accompanied by vivid photographs of various moments of his life, this book is a fascinating portrait of the achievements and teachings of an acclaimed spiritual pioneer. A vibrant picture of an impassioned life, By God’s Grace is a breathtaking tapestry of exotic journeys, meetings with remarkable people, and practical wisdom from his extraordinary life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>3 Volume Set</p>
<p>This verse-by-verse translation and commentary illustrates the Gita’s lofty insight with everyday events and contemporary problems familiar to all of us. Full of insights, stories and practical spiritual exercises, each volume of this set covers six chapters of the Gita and can be read on its own. The three volumes of The Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living together form a comprehensive manual for living a spiritual life.</p>
<p>VOLUME I: THE END OF SORROW</p>
<p>The End of Sorrow, the first volume of The Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living, concentrates on the individual: the nature of our innermost Self, how it can be discovered in the depths of consciousness and how this discovery transforms daily life. The introduction includes instructions in Easwaran’s universal method of passage meditation.</p>
<p>VOLUME II: LIKE A THOUSAND SUNS</p>
<p>Like a Thousand Suns, the second volume of The Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living, bridges scientific knowledge, spiritual understanding and the indivisible unity governing all creations. Easwaran illustrates the steps we can take to realise this unity and heal divisions within society and in ourselves.</p>
<p>VOLUME III: TO LOVE IS TO KNOW ME</p>
<p>To Love Is to Know Me, the third volume of The Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living, is global in scope but its emphasis is on individuals: what you and I can do. Easwaran presents life as a field where actions and desires are sown like seeds, which germinate, grow and yield fruits that eventually scatter more seeds. This vast network of cause and effect is what the Sanskrit word Karma denotes, and Easwaran offers many examples to illustrate its immense reach and “how everyday choices, taken together, can lead a society to violence and waste or to a higher way of living.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sadhvi Bhagawati Saraswati, from Hollywood, California, had a privileged upbringing that hid some dark secrets. She grappled with an eating disorder and trauma from her early childhood for years. But, as a Stanford grad getting her PhD in Psychology, she felt she was successfully navigating adulthood. After getting married, when she agreed to travel to India to appease her husband, little did Sadhviji know a journey of healing and awakening awaited her. She had everything the material world could offer. Soon, she would give it all up to follow the divine path.</p>
<p>Hollywood to the Himalayas describes Sadhviji’s odyssey towards divine enlightenment and inspiration through her extraordinary connection with her guru and renewed confidence in the pleasure and joy that life can bring. Now one of the preeminent female spiritual teachers in the world, Sadhviji recounts her journey with wit, honesty, and clarity. Along the way, she offers teachings to help us all step onto our own path of awakening and discover the truth of who we really are—embodiments of the Divine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to psychologist and mindfulness expert Rochelle Calvert, one of the greatest sources of healing from trauma is all around us—nature.</p>
<p>In this powerful book, Calvert explores how to relate to and connect with nature through mindfulness. She integrates many nature-based principles and somatic practices, applying them in innovative ways to address pain, showing in particular how to ground oneself.</p>
<p>She shows how it’s possible to relax the nervous system and tune in to the somatic wisdom of the body, to face lingering grief and rewire it.</p>
<p>As a nature meditation teacher, the author offers reflections and activities that connect with a person’s true self, all while using nature as a grounding and connecting restorative force.</p>
<p>With the help of this book, you’ll be able to work with painful experiences to transform them in ways that heal you and contribute<br />
to healing the wider world.</p>
<p>Healing with Nature pioneers a path not just to recovery but to lifelong healing and resilience.</p>
