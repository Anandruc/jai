										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As one of the first female F-14 Tomcat fighter pilots in the US Navy, as well as a mom, wife, business consultant, Wall Street Journal bestselling author, and global speaker, Carey Lohrenz knows that the stress we experience can be just as intense as the stress in the cockpit of a fighter jet going Mach 2. But she’s got a secret weapon to prevail: years of training to overcome the specific natures of uncertainty, stress, burnout, anxiety, and pressure.</p>
<p>In Span of Control, Lohrenz walks us through the fundamentals of surviving and succeeding during times of crisis. To thrive when the pressure is on and to improve our performance overall, we’ve got to know what we can and cannot control.</p>
<p>Weaving together eye-opening science, gripping personal stories, insightful interviews, prescriptive advice, and a high-octane dose of encouragement and practicality, Span of Control helps leaders recognize how to focus on what matters most, formulate a plan for success, and communicate what’s possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But “just do it” usually just doesn’t work. Long-time creativity coach and therapist Eric Maisel has found an approach that does work: giving clients, andnow readers, a clear understanding of what makes them personally blocked or stuck and unable to start or finish.</p>
<p>Not enough time, resources, or talent? Fear of success, guilt about being “selfish,” and variations on the theme of “what’s the point?” Maisel has spent 30 years helping people overcome these kinds of blocks with skills including anxiety management, positive self-talk, cognitive behavioral therapy, and even “sleep thinking.”</p>
<p>The tools Maisel offers are a potent alternative to waiting for the spirit to move or the muse to inspire: a sustainable, self-directed path to success.</p>
