										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world, people don’t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together.</p>
<p>In The Psychology of Money, the author shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life’s most important matters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreword by Alyque Padamsee<br />
Preface by Lara Dutta</p>
<p>Sabira Merchant is a name you associate with sophistication and good taste. A trendsetter, she added sparkle to Mumbai’s performing arts scene with her presence.</p>
<p>Bold, beautiful and brilliant, Sabira is India’s beloved thespian, celebrated quiz queen, and renowned grooming and etiquette expert. From bringing disco to the city—her nightclub Studio 29 ushered in a new era in Mumbai’s nightlife, causing a frenzy among partygoers in the ’80s—to training beauty queens such as Priyanka Chopra and Lara Dutta before they went on to win their crowns, Sabira’s legacy can leave anyone green with envy.</p>
<p>For a suburban Muslim girl who got married in her teens to the love of her life and had three children one after the other, the feats Sabira has accomplished are astounding and inspiring, given how difficult it was for women back then to balance personal life and career, that too in theatre, radio and television. In her memoir A Full Life, Sabira recounts her eventful journey—her triumphs, setbacks, joys, fears and hopes—and through her journey, a rare glimpse into Mumbai’s glorious past.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Rajini’s Mantras, bestselling author P.C. Balasubramanian brings out the best life lessons from Rajinikanth’s iconic speeches, public interactions and performances right from his early days in the film industry.</p>
<p>Rajinikanth, endearingly called ‘Thalaivar’ (leader) by his fans, is an inspiration to millions. His spectacular success story, from a bus conductor to one of the most-loved superstars in Indian cinema, is as gripping as a megahit.</p>
<p>His life is an excellent blueprint if you want to understand how to achieve goals without compromising your values or individuality.</p>
<p>Taking several incidents from Rajini’s life, Balasubramanian shows how an adaptable mindset, willingness to learn from experiences, persistence and making the right choices can help you stand out—just like the beloved idol.</p>
<p>Moreover, the simplicity of each of these mantras highlights the positive influence you can have on society and those around you.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope that my fans and every reader would find this book relevant and enriching&#8221;<br />
