										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Conflict We Face—and How to Fight Back</p>
<p>China poses an existential threat to America, warns a veteran intelligence officer, and the window for an effective response is closing fast.</p>
<p>Col. Grant Newsham, a former reserve head of intelligence for Marine Forces Pacific, delivers a blow-by-blow account of how the threat has developed, from the growing skill and belligerence of the Chinese military to gray-zone campaigns to hollow out America’s will to resist—efforts that have now reached fruition. </p>
<p>The question is not whether the Chinese will attack. They already have. The question is, will America fight back before the cold war that Communist China is waging against America and its allies goes hot?</p>
<p>The flash point will be Taiwan, but the war will extend throughout the the Pacific and beyond, and the results could be devastating. America risks a humiliating retreat, with almost unimaginable costs to the country’s economy and security. </p>
<p>The conflict is coming. We’re not ready. Is American defeat inevitable? No, but we must change course immediately. And to do that, we must wake up and heed the sobering message of When China Attacks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Practical, real-life methods to become the luckiest person you know, with no lucky charms or rituals needed to beat the odds.</p>
<p>Luck—we’re not sure what it is, but we know we want it on our side. Is luck a cosmic force that we can randomly stumble upon, or is there something real that people we consider lucky have discovered? The Science of Being Lucky is an in-depth look at what all lucky people have in common and how they set themselves up for success time after time.</p>
<p>Put success into your own hands, not fate’s.</p>
<p>The Science of Being Lucky takes you on a science-based journey into what luck is, what we think it is, and how to get more of it in your life. The journey begins by breaking down and defining the lucky breaks, coincidences, and serendipitous events in our lives—then delves into the specific traits, life factors, and perspectives that create lucky outcomes.</p>
<p>This book will open your eyes to what is behind each moment you would call lucky and give you a concrete action plan to create more of the same. Luck doesn’t have to be just fantasy. Here’s what’s inside to make you immune to bad luck:<br />
•  Popular methods for luck—do they work? (Some do, some do not)<br />
•  Avoiding bad luck internally and externally<br />
•  Three traits that practically manufacture luck<br />
•  Max Gunther’s famous “strategic luck planning” approach to life</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine’s most popular comedic actor was an unlikely president of his country. And now, even more improbably, Volodymyr Zelensky has become the world’s most celebrated statesman. Who is he? How did he become the international hero of our time?</p>
<p>Zelensky: The Unlikely Ukrainian Hero Who Defied Putin and United the World is a compelling account of this fascinating, enigmatic leader. Covering Zelensky’s childhood, family history, and astonishing transformation from TV celebrity to first Jewish president of Ukraine, this book tells you what you need to know about the newest star of the world stage.</p>
<p>No one has been more surprised by Zelensky’s power to inspire and mobilize his countrymen and the world than Vladimir Putin, who expected Russia’s conquest of its beleaguered neighbor to be the work of an afternoon. Outfoxed and isolated, Putin is not the first person to have underestimated the former comedian with a spine of steel.</p>
<p>Foreword by Rebekah Koffler, US intelligence expert &amp; author</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talks on Ko Hsuan’s The Classic of Purity</p>
<p>“Tao seems to be the only life vision which is total. It does not deny the earth, it does not deny the sky. It accepts both, it accepts the<br />
unity of both. It says the man who has come to know spontaneous purity and stillness, who has become relaxed with the whole, with<br />
the law of the ultimate—in him heaven and earth are united. “I believe in the whole. To me, to trust the whole is the only way to be holy and to trust the whole is the only way to be whole. And when you are whole, life is bliss, life is benediction, life is a celebration.”<br />
-Osho</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Benjamin Franklin’s life was nothing short of astonishing. A polymath, he excelled in multiple fields, be it writing, publishing, politics, science, diplomacy or philosophy. One of the Founding Fathers, he is also known as the First American for his efforts in unifying the colonies to form today’s America.</p>
<p>In his autobiography, Franklin talks about his childhood, family, early career as a printing apprentice to his brother and his move from Boston to Philadelphia. His love for books shines through in his writing, and he shares practical advice for budding writers on improving their skills. Through his charming, original narration, he offers readers a close look at his life before the American Revolution. </p>
<p>Franklin’s life is the perfect example of achieving the famed American dream, but he didn’t consider himself to be perfect. His honest revelations and reflections on how he strived to be a better person through self-development make this autobiography a moving read. Franklin’s takes on how one<br />
can improve one’s own character, habits and performance are still relevant to all those determined to do their best in any given circumstance.</p>
