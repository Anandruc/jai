Yet abundant vestiges are still evident of the once much larger ancient Bene Israel, and the more recent \u00e9migr\u00e9 Baghdadi Jews. Monuments and sites of both communities are preserved in Mumbai (Bombay) and Pune (Poona), as well as in the smaller towns in the northern Konkan region. They include synagogues and cemeteries that testify to the enduring faith of Jews in India, as well as hospitals, schools, libraries and research institutions that demonstrate the philanthropy of wealthy Jewish families, such as the Sassoons. Warehouses and textile mills linked with Jewish industrialists contributed to the expansion of Mumbai during the 19th century; statues and other civic monuments in the city commemorate prominent Jewish figures.<\/p>\n<p>Co-authored by Kenneth X. Robbins and Pushkar Sohoni, this guidebook is illustrated with splendid, newly commissioned photographs by Surendra Kumar. It is the first such publication to describe the vestiges listed above, which are arranged according to itineraries to encourage citizens of Mumbai and Pune, as well as visitors to these cities and the towns of the Konkan, to discover this often overlooked aspect of local history. Intended as a handy reference to the Jewish presence in Maharashtra, the volume should contribute to a better appreciation of this significant aspect of Deccan history, and hopefully to the preservation of Jewish sites and monuments for future generations.<\/p>\n<p>Surendra Kumar is a photographer based in Hampi, Karnataka, specialising in topographic panoramas. His images are published in Discovering the Deccan: A Panoramic Journey Through Historical Landscapes &amp; Monuments (Mumbai, 2011), Temple Architecture and Art of the Early Chalukyas (New Delhi, 2014), Hyderabad, Golconda (Mumbai, 2015), and Portuguese Sea Forts (Mumbai, 2016).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jews living today in the state of Maharashtra in the Deccan region of India number little more than several thousand persons.
