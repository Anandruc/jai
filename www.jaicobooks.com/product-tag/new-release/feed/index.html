										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talks on Ko Hsuan’s The Classic of Purity</p>
<p>“Tao seems to be the only life vision which is total. It does not deny the earth, it does not deny the sky. It accepts both, it accepts the<br />
unity of both. It says the man who has come to know spontaneous purity and stillness, who has become relaxed with the whole, with<br />
the law of the ultimate—in him heaven and earth are united. “I believe in the whole. To me, to trust the whole is the only way to be holy and to trust the whole is the only way to be whole. And when you are whole, life is bliss, life is benediction, life is a celebration.”<br />
-Osho</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine’s most popular comedic actor was an unlikely president of his country. And now, even more improbably, Volodymyr Zelensky has become the world’s most celebrated statesman. Who is he? How did he become the international hero of our time?</p>
<p>Zelensky: The Unlikely Ukrainian Hero Who Defied Putin and United the World is a compelling account of this fascinating, enigmatic leader. Covering Zelensky’s childhood, family history, and astonishing transformation from TV celebrity to first Jewish president of Ukraine, this book tells you what you need to know about the newest star of the world stage.</p>
<p>No one has been more surprised by Zelensky’s power to inspire and mobilize his countrymen and the world than Vladimir Putin, who expected Russia’s conquest of its beleaguered neighbor to be the work of an afternoon. Outfoxed and isolated, Putin is not the first person to have underestimated the former comedian with a spine of steel.</p>
<p>Foreword by Rebekah Koffler, US intelligence expert &amp; author</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Diary of a Young Girl is a simple and touching chronicling of a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl’s years in hiding from the Nazis during World War II.  Anne Frank, the diarist, was on the cusp of adolescence when her family had to flee Germany and take shelter in the Netherlands. The Franks were forced to live for two years confined in the attic before they were captured and sent to concentration camps.  </p>
<p>Anne manages to capture the horrors of being Jewish under the Nazi occupation through her recording of day-to-day life. Vivid, thoughtful and moving words describe the years of hunger, hardships and strained relationships between family members sharing limited space under the constant threat of discovery and subsequent arrest or death.</p>
<p>An important contribution to history, this honest account of life under tyranny resonates across time and around the world even today. Anne’s writing is a testimony to the human spirit’s ability to remain positive and hopeful amidst chaos and uncertainty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For over 35 years, Osho spoke to international audiences of seekers, addressing their essential questions and concerns. The international press calls him “A 21st Century Prophet” and “an oracle of modern times.” His books and audio lectures are international bestsellers.</p>
<p>Osho himself says that he is neither a prophet nor a philosopher; he is simply sharing his own experience. The Sunday Times of London described him as “one of the 1000 makers of the 20th century” and American author Tom Robbins has called him “the most dangerous man since Jesus Christ”—both comments reflecting the profound influence of his revolutionary approach to the science of inner transformation.</p>
<p>Spoken with authority, clarity, sharpness and humor, his insights address both the timeless and timely concerns that tend to escape our notice in the clamor and overload of daily life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Benjamin Franklin’s life was nothing short of astonishing. A polymath, he excelled in multiple fields, be it writing, publishing, politics, science, diplomacy or philosophy. One of the Founding Fathers, he is also known as the First American for his efforts in unifying the colonies to form today’s America.</p>
<p>In his autobiography, Franklin talks about his childhood, family, early career as a printing apprentice to his brother and his move from Boston to Philadelphia. His love for books shines through in his writing, and he shares practical advice for budding writers on improving their skills. Through his charming, original narration, he offers readers a close look at his life before the American Revolution. </p>
<p>Franklin’s life is the perfect example of achieving the famed American dream, but he didn’t consider himself to be perfect. His honest revelations and reflections on how he strived to be a better person through self-development make this autobiography a moving read. Franklin’s takes on how one<br />
can improve one’s own character, habits and performance are still relevant to all those determined to do their best in any given circumstance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;The Psychology of Money&#8217; Nepali Edition.</p>
<p>How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world, people don’t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together.</p>
<p>In The Psychology of Money, the author shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life’s most important matters.</p>
<p>Morgan Housel is a partner at The Collaborative Fund and a former columnist at The Motley Fool and The Wall Street Journal. He is a two-time winner of the Best in Business Award from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers, winner of the New York Times Sidney Award, and a two-time finalist for the Gerald Loeb Award for distinguished Business and Financial Journalism</p>
