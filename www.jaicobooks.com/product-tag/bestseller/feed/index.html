										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world, people don’t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together.</p>
<p>In The Psychology of Money, the author shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life’s most important matters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stephen Hawking is widely believed to be one of the world’s greatest minds: a brilliant theoretical physicist whose work helped to reconfigure models of the universe and to redefine what’s in it. Imagine sitting in a room listening to Hawking discuss these achievements and place them in historical context. It would be like hearing Christopher Columbus on the New World.</p>
<p>Hawking presents a series of seven lec-tures—covering everything from big bang to black holes to string theory—that capture not only the brilliance of Hawking’s mind but his characteristic wit as well. Of his research on black holes, which absorbed him for more than a decade, he says, “It might seem a bit like looking for a black cat in a coal cellar.”</p>
<p>Hawking begins with a history of ideas about the universe, from Aristotle’s determination that the Earth is round to Hubble’s discovery, over 2000 years later, that the universe is expanding. Using that as a launching pad, he explores the reaches of modern physics, including theories on the origin of the universe (e.g., the big bang), the nature of black holes, and space-time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emotion: The Juice of Life</p>
<p>“One can make any emotion into a creative force in one’s life.”<br />
– Sadhguru</p>
<p>It’s not just poetic license that allows us to refer to emotions as “juicy”. In a literal sense also, emotions are a chemical cocktail that course through our bodies. But while we have no problems with pleasant emotions, unpleasant emotions are the source of much angst in our lives. In Emotion: The Juice of Life, Sadhguru looks at the gamut of human emotions and how to turn them into stepping stones rather than stumbling blocks.</p>
<p>Relationships Bond or Bondage</p>
<p>“If you enhance yourself into a very beautiful state, everyone will want to hold a relationship with you.”<br />
– Sadhguru</p>
<p>Human beings constantly make and break relationships. Unfortunately, relationships can make and break human beings too. Why are relationships such a circus for most of us? What is this primal urge within us that demands a bond – physical, mental, or emotional – with another? And how do we keep this bond from turning into bondage? These are the fundamental questions that Relationships: Bond or Bondage looks at as Sadhguru shares with us the keys to forming lasting and joyful relationships, whether they are with husband or wife, family and friends, at work, or with the very existence itself.</p>

In the course of this book, Sadhguru explores the yogic physiology and the many subtle dimensions of the body.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Written 2,500 years ago by Chinese general Sun Tzu, The Art of War is a poetic and potent treatise on military strategy still in use in war colleges around the world. Yet its principles transcend warfare and have practical applications to all the conflicts and crises we face in our lives – in our workplaces, our families, even within ourselves.</p>
<p>Thomas Huynh guides you through Sun Tzu’s masterwork, highlighting principles that encourage a perceptive and spiritual approach to conflict, enabling you to:<br />
— Prevent conflicts before they arise<br />
— Peacefully and quickly resolve conflicts when they do arise<br />
— Act with courage, intelligence and benevolence in adversarial situations<br />
— Convert potential enemies into friends<br />
— Control your emotions before they control you</p>
<p>Now you can experience the effectiveness of Sun Tzu’s teachings even if you have no previous knowledge of The Art of War. Insightful yet unobtrusive facing-page commentary explains the subtleties of the text, allowing you to unlock the power of its teachings and help prevent and resolve the conflicts in your own life.</p>
