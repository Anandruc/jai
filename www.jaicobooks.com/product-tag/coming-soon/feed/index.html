<p>USE WILLPOWER TO ACHIEVE THE LIFE THAT YOU WANT.</p>
<p>Most people can&#8217;t accomplish what they want. They let themselves underachieve and don&#8217;t have the energy to do better. But you are different. You will learn the true meaning of mind over matter.</p>
<p>The Self-Discipline Manual is about training you (yes, training) to achieve everything that you want, and nothing less. It&#8217;s about understanding what causes motivation and self-discipline, and how to attack your daily tasks, habits, or goals with the fire of a thousand suns. We tackle this issue of you versus yourself from every possible angle so you become well-armed to face your lazy and procrastinating ways.</p>
<p>Inside, bestselling author Peter Hollins discusses:<br />
•  The biology of self-control and how to hack your body&#8217;s limitations<br />
•  Understanding all the roadblocks to motivation and self-control—almost all are psychological<br />
•  Why you must start managing your TIME, not your energy<br />
•  The role your neurotransmitters play in self-discipline<br />
•  How to make discomfort your best friend</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Practical, real-life methods to become the luckiest person you know, with no lucky charms or rituals needed to beat the odds.</p>
<p>Luck—we’re not sure what it is, but we know we want it on our side. Is luck a cosmic force that we can randomly stumble upon, or is there something real that people we consider lucky have discovered? The Science of Being Lucky is an in-depth look at what all lucky people have in common and how they set themselves up for success time after time.</p>
<p>Put success into your own hands, not fate’s.</p>
<p>The Science of Being Lucky takes you on a science-based journey into what luck is, what we think it is, and how to get more of it in your life. The journey begins by breaking down and defining the lucky breaks, coincidences, and serendipitous events in our lives—then delves into the specific traits, life factors, and perspectives that create lucky outcomes.</p>
<p>This book will open your eyes to what is behind each moment you would call lucky and give you a concrete action plan to create more of the same. Luck doesn’t have to be just fantasy. Here’s what’s inside to make you immune to bad luck:<br />
•  Popular methods for luck—do they work? (Some do, some do not)<br />
•  Avoiding bad luck internally and externally<br />
•  Three traits that practically manufacture luck<br />
•  Max Gunther’s famous “strategic luck planning” approach to life</p>

Osho illuminates the very essence of each question and gives his uniquely tailored responses to such topics as: the meditative qualities of the new man; the art of being fully alive; the misuse of power and how power can be used creatively. He inspires all who are courageous enough to take a step upon the unknown spiritual path. A path which, because unknown, can feel both perilous and ecstatic—as if being on the razor’s edge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Conflict We Face—and How to Fight Back</p>
<p>China poses an existential threat to America, warns a veteran intelligence officer, and the window for an effective response is closing fast.</p>
<p>Col. Grant Newsham, a former reserve head of intelligence for Marine Forces Pacific, delivers a blow-by-blow account of how the threat has developed, from the growing skill and belligerence of the Chinese military to gray-zone campaigns to hollow out America’s will to resist—efforts that have now reached fruition. </p>
<p>The question is not whether the Chinese will attack. They already have. The question is, will America fight back before the cold war that Communist China is waging against America and its allies goes hot?</p>
<p>The flash point will be Taiwan, but the war will extend throughout the the Pacific and beyond, and the results could be devastating. America risks a humiliating retreat, with almost unimaginable costs to the country’s economy and security. </p>
<p>The conflict is coming. We’re not ready. Is American defeat inevitable? No, but we must change course immediately. And to do that, we must wake up and heed the sobering message of When China Attacks.</p>

Raw, gut-wrenching in its honesty and completely from the heart, this is storytelling at its finest.</p>
<p>A young boy with a &#8216;refugee&#8217; tag growing up in Delhi&#8217;s Malviya Nagar outpaces his circumstances by becoming a rank-holder at the pinnacle of academic excellence in India-IIT Delhi. He goes on to do an MBA from the hallowed halls of IIM Ahmedabad, builds a career as an investment banker at Kotak Investment Banking and AmEx, and is pivotal in the making of two unicorns-Grofers, as CFO, and BharatPe, as co-founder.</p>
<p>As a judge on the popular TV show Shark Tank India, Ashneer becomes a household name even as his life turns upside down. Controversy, media spotlight, garrulous social media chatter descend, making it difficult to distinguish fact from fiction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re like most 21st century sojourners you may have had a hard time answering that question. Peace is after all a word from the realm of spirituality. It&#8217;s not always easy to hear the small voice over the cacophony of ringing cell phones the constant blare of the TV and the discordant honks and curses of rush hour.</p>
<p>This book the autobiography of Pandit Rajmani Tigunait provides a glimpse of an entirely different way of living. Readers of TOUCHED BY FIRE may follow this extraordinary man on a journey from his birth place in an ancient village in India to his current home in the rolling hills of north-eastern Pennsylvania where he serves as spiritual head of the Himalayan Institute. Along the way you&#8217;ll meet a variety of teachers who guided Tigunait in crafting a contemplative life filled with spiritual richness wisdom and inner peace.</p>
<p>This book is not a how to guide to enlightenment. Nor is it a call to any particular religious tradition. But in its description of Tigunait&#8217;s life-the years of disciplined study and the struggle to master emotions like anger despair and pride-some of the keys are revealed. And its ultimate message that we&#8217;re all the same beneath our culture religious and political facades is desperately needed in our world of tumult and tears.</p>
